The UCR was designed to provide nationally representative estimates of the level and change in level of crimes known to and recorded by the police as well as arrested persons. To obtain these data, the FBI surveys state and local police organizations. Because not all types of crime are equally well reported to the police, the UCR focuses on seven types of crime that are (1) prevalent, (2) serious, and (3) well reported to the police. These seven types of crime are known as Part I offenses and constitute the Crime Index; they are homicide, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and motor-vehicle theft. (Arson was added in 1978, but is not reported as part of the Crime Index.) Participants in the UCR report all of these crimes coming to their attention. The reporting of other offenses (Part II offenses) is not required of jurisdictions that participate in the program. Arrests made in both Part I and Part II categories are reported, as well as data on law enforcement personnel.","keyword":["homicide","forcible rape","robbery","aggravated assault","burglary","larceny-theft","motor-vehicle theft","arson"],"modified":"2005-07-03T00:00:00Z","publisher":"Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention","contactPoint":"Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice Information Services Division Attention: Uniform Crime Reports","mbox":"ucrstat@leo.gov","identifier":"Uniform Crime Reports, Summary Reporting of Offenses and Arrests","accessLevel":"public","accessLevelComment":null,"bureauCode":["011:00"],"programCode":["011:061"],"accessURL":"http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57","format":"application/pdf","license":null,"spatial":null,"temporal":"1975-01-01T00:00:00Z/2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","theme":null,"dataDictionary":null,"dataQuality":null,"accrualPeriodicity":null,"landingPage":null,"language":null,"PrimaryITInvestmentUII":null,"references":null,"issued":null,"systemOfRecords":null},

The Blueprint called for a program that would involve incident-based reporting (data on each reported crime incident) rather than jurisdiction-based (summary) reporting, and would include more extensive information on crimes, victims, and offenders than the UCR.

The national YRBS is the backbone of the YRBSS; it focuses on health-risk behaviors among youth that result in mortality, morbidity, disability, and social problems during both youth and adulthood. The monitored behaviors include substance use, behaviors that may result in violence and unintentional injuries, sexual behaviors that may result in HIV infection or other sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancies, unhealthy dietary behaviors, and inadequate physical activity. The national school-based survey was administered first in 1990, then in 1991, and in every second year thereafter. The state and city school-based surveys are similar to the national survey but are not nationally representative.","keyword":["demographics","weapons","victimization","sexual assault","rape","fights","suicide; tobacco","alcohol","sexually transmitted diseases"],"modified":"2005-07-03T00:00:00Z","publisher":"Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention","contactPoint":"Dr. Jo Anne Grundbaum, Ed.D","mbox":"jpg9@cdc.gov","identifier":"The National Youth Risk Behavior Survey","accessLevel":"public","accessLevelComment":null,"bureauCode":["011:00"],"programCode":["011:061"],"accessURL":"http://www.cdc.gov/HealthyYouth/yrbs/data/index.htm","format":"text/html","license":null,"spatial":null,"temporal":"1995-01-01T00:00:00Z/2011-12-31T00:00:00Z","theme":null,"dataDictionary":null,"dataQuality":null,"accrualPeriodicity":null,"landingPage":null,"language":null,"PrimaryITInvestmentUII":null,"references":null,"issued":null,"systemOfRecords":null},

The survey provides measures for the following types of crimes, including attempts: rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault (including both simple and aggravated), burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. In addition to estimating the number of victimizations, the NCVS gathers details on each incident insofar as the victim can report them. These include the month, time, and location of the crime; the relationship between victim and offender; characteristics of the offender; self-protective actions taken by the victim during an incident and results of those actions; consequences of the victimization, including any injury or property loss; whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting; suspected gang involvement by the offender; and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol.","keyword":["rape","sexual assault","sexual crimes"],"modified":"2005-07-03T00:00:00Z","publisher":"Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention","contactPoint":"Michael R.

The records check provided detailed information for 5,867 probationers on current offenses and sentences, criminal histories, levels of supervision and contacts, disciplinary hearings and outcomes, and demographic characteristics. Only adults with a formal sentence to probation who were not considered absconders were included in the records check. Excluded were persons supervised by a federal probation agency, those only on parole, persons on presentence or pretrial diversion, juveniles, and absconders. The records check forms were completed by a probation officer or by another person knowledgeable about probation office records. A subset of the population selected for the records check was selected for a personal interview, resulting in a total of 2,030 completed interviews. The personal interview sample excluded from the records check sample probationers not on active probation (defined as being required to make office visits at any interval), those incarcerated, and those in residential treatment. Respondents were asked about current offense(s) and supervision, criminal history, alcohol and drug use and treatment, mental health treatment, demographic characteristics, and a variety of socioeconomic characteristics such as employment, income, receipt of welfare, housing, number of children and child support, and living conditions while growing up.","keyword":["arrest records","criminal histories","demographic characteristics","offender profiles","probation","probationers","sentencing","supervised liberty"],"modified":"2006-03-30T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The survey's purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. The data collection instrument was based on questions that were included in the NATIONAL PROSECUTORS SURVEY, 1994 (ICPSR 6785), and also added queries on topics of current concern. Variables cover staffing, workload, funding, what type of computer access the office had, whether the office was part of an integrated computerized system with other specific criminal agencies, the use of DNA evidence in plea negotiations of felony trials, which laboratories performed these DNA analyses, juvenile matters, and risks associated with the role of the prosecutor, such as threatening letters or calls, face-to-face assaults, or batter/assaults. The unit of analysis is the district office.","keyword":["attorneys","case processing","criminal investigations","district attorneys","DNA fingerprinting","evidence","felony courts","felony offenses","juvenile courts","personnel","plea negotiations","policies and procedures","prosecuting attorneys","prosecution","sentencing","state courts","training","treatment programs","trial procedures","victim services"],"modified":"2005-11-04T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk [United States], 1996","description":"Researchers have long been able to analyze crime and law enforcement data at the individual agency level (see UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA: [UNITED STATES] [ICPSR 9028]) and at the county level (see, for example, UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA [UNITED STATES]: COUNTY-LEVEL DETAILED ARREST AND OFFENSE DATA, 1997 [ICPSR 2764]). However, analyzing crime data at the intermediate level, the city or place, has been difficult. To facilitate the creation and analysis of place-level data, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) created the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk. The crosswalk file was designed to provide geographic and other identification information for each record included in either the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) files or BJS's Directory of Law Enforcement Agencies. The main variables for each record are the UCR originating agency identifier number, agency name, mailing address, Census Bureau's government identification number, UCR state and county codes, and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county, and place codes. These variables make it possible for researchers to take police agency-level data, combine them with Bureau of the Census and BJS data, and perform place-level, jurisdiction-level, and government-level analyses.","keyword":["crime mapping","crime patterns","databases","information systems","law enforcement agencies"],"modified":"2001-09-20T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 1992-2000","description":"The National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes cover rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes cover burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft) as well as personal crimes against him- or herself. The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2013-09-18T13:06:02Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Police-Public Contact Survey, 1999: [United States]","description":"This survey was undertaken to learn more about how often and under what circumstances police-public contact becomes problematic. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) initiated surveys of the public on their interactions with police in 1996 with the first Police-Public Contact Survey, a pretest among a nationally representative sample of 6,421 persons aged 12 or older. That initial version of the questionnaire revealed that about 20 percent of the public had direct, face-to-face contact with a police officer at least once during the year preceding the survey. At that time, the principal investigator estimated that about 1 in 500 residents, or about a half million people, who had an encounter with a police officer also experienced either a threat of force or the actual use of force by the officer. The current survey, an improved version of the 1996 Police-Public Contact Survey, was fielded as a supplement to the National Crime Victimization Survey (ICPSR 6406) during the last six months of 1999. A national sample nearly 15 times as large as the pretest sample in 1996 was used. The 1999 survey yielded nearly identical estimates of the prevalence and nature of contacts between the public and the police. This survey, because of its much larger sample size, permits more extensive analysis of demographic differences in police contacts than the 1996 pretest. In addition, it added a new and more detailed set of questions about traffic stops by police, the most frequent reason given for contact with police. Variables in the dataset cover type of contact with police, including whether it was face-to-face, initiated by the police or the citizen, whether an injury to the officer or the citizen resulted from the contact, crimes reported, and police use of force. Demographic variables supplied for the citizens include gender, race, and Hispanic origin.","keyword":["police citizen interactions","police community relations","police officers","police use of force","public interest","public opinion"],"modified":"2001-06-18T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Jail Census, 1999","description":"The 1999 Census of Jails is the seventh in a series of data collection efforts aimed at studying the nation's locally administered jails. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1988, and 1993. The 1999 census enumerated 3,365 locally administered confinement facilities that held inmates beyond arraignment and were staffed by municipal or county employees. Among these were 47 privately operated jails under contract for local governments and 42 regional jails that were operated for two or more jail authorities. In addition, the census identified 11 facilities maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons that functioned as jails. The nationwide total of the number of jails in operation on June 30, 1999, was 3,376. For purposes of this data collection, a local jail was defined as a locally operated adult detention facility that receives individuals pending arraignment and holds them awaiting trial, conviction, or sentencing, readmits probation, parole, and bail-bond violators and absconders, temporarily detains juveniles pending transfer to juvenile authorities, holds mentally ill persons pending their movement to appropriate health facilities, holds individuals for the military, for protective custody, for contempt, and for the courts as witnesses, releases convicted inmates to the community upon completion of sentence, transfers inmates to federal, state, or other authorities, houses inmates for federal, state, or other authorities because of crowding of their facilities, relinquishes custody of temporary detainees to juvenile and medical authorities, operates community-based programs with day-reporting, home detention, electronic monitoring, or other types of supervision, and holds inmates sentenced to short terms. Variables include information on jail population by legal status, age and sex of prisoners, maximum sentence, admissions and releases, available services and programs, structure and capacity, facility age and use of space, expenditure, employment, staff information, and health issues, which include statistics on drugs, AIDS, and tuberculosis.","keyword":["census data","correctional facilities","correctional system","corrections management","demographic characteristics","inmate populations","inmate programs","inmates","jail inmates","jails"],"modified":"2009-07-09T10:27:21Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The majority of the database consists of information on each released prisoner's entire officially recorded criminal history (before and after the 1994 release). Sources for criminal history information are state and FBI automated RAP (\"Records of Arrests and Prosecutions\") sheets, which contain records of arrests, adjudications, and sentences. The study is the second major recidivism study conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The first study, RECIDIVISM AMONG RELEASED PRISONERS, 1983: [UNITED STATES] (ICPSR 8875), tracked over 16,000 prisoners released in 11 states in 1983 for three years. These two studies are the closest approximation to \"national\" recidivism studies in the United States. They are distinguished by their large sample size (over 16,000 released prisoners in the first study, 38,624 in the second), geographic breadth of coverage (11 states in the first study, 15 in the second), length of prospective tracking (three years from date of release in both studies), ability to track the movement of released prisoners across state boundaries (both studies), and multiple measures of recidivism (both studies).

For 2001, instead of a survey of chief prosecutors, a census of all 2,341 chief prosecutors who handled felony cases in state courts of general jurisdiction was conducted. A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The census' purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. Variables cover staffing, funding, special categories of felony prosecutions, caseload, juvenile matters, work-related threats or assaults, the use of DNA evidence, and community-related activities, such as involvement in neighborhood associations. The unit of analysis is the district office.","keyword":["attorneys","case processing","district attorneys","evidence","felony courts","felony offenses","plea negotiations","policies and procedures","prosecuting attorneys","prosecution","sentencing","state courts","trial procedures"],"modified":"2005-11-04T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 1992-2001","description":"The National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2013-09-18T13:07:33Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2013-09-18T13:09:10Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

SCPS 1998 tracked felony cases filed in May 1998 until final disposition or until one year had elapsed from the date of filing. SCPS 1998 presents data on felony cases filed in approximately 40 of the nation's 75 most populous counties in 1998. These 75 counties account for more than a third of the United States population and approximately half of all reported crimes. The cases from these 40 jurisdictions were weighted to represent all felony filings during the month of May in the 75 most populous counties. Data were collected on arrest charges, demographic characteristics, criminal history, pretrial release and detention, adjudication, and sentencing. Within each sampled site, data were gathered on each juvenile felony case. Cases were tracked through adjudication or for up to one year. The source used to identify the upper age for juveniles and the filing mechanism appropriate to each state was the OJJDP publication, Trying Juveniles as Adults in Criminal Court: An Analysis of State Transfer Provisions (December 1998).","keyword":["case processing","criminal histories","court cases","defendants","disposition (legal)","felony courts","felons","juveniles","pretrial detention","pretrial release","sentencing","state courts","statistical data"],"modified":"2003-09-25T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk [United States], 2000","description":"Researchers have long been able to analyze crime and law enforcement data at the individual agency level (see UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA: [UNITED STATES] [ICPSR 9028]) and at the county level (see, for example, UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA [UNITED STATES]: COUNTY-LEVEL DETAILED ARREST AND OFFENSE DATA, 1997 [ICPSR 2764]). However, analyzing crime data at the intermediate level, the city or place, has been difficult. To facilitate the creation and analysis of place-level data, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) and the National Archive of Criminal Justice Data (NACJD) created the Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk. The crosswalk file was designed to provide geographic and other identification information for each record included in either the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) files or BJS's Directory of Law Enforcement Agencies. The main variables for each record are the UCR originating agency identifier number, agency name, mailing address, Census Bureau's government identification number, UCR state and county codes, and Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) state, county, and place codes. These variables make it possible for researchers to take police agency-level data, combine them with Bureau of the Census and BJS data, and perform place-level, jurisdiction-level, and government-level analyses.","keyword":["crime mapping","crime patterns","databases","information systems","law enforcement agencies"],"modified":"2004-09-16T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals, 2001","description":"The 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals is a follow-up to the CIVIL JUSTICE SURVEY OF STATE COURTS, 2001 (ICPSR 3957) which examined 8,311 general civil cases (e.g., tort, contract, and real property) concluded by bench or jury trial in a sample of 46 of the nation's 75 most populous counties in 2001. These cases were then weighted to represent the 11,908 general civil trials concluded in the nation's 75 most populous counties. Data from the 2001 Civil Trial Survey were used to produce several Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) reports describing the characteristics of civil litigation in state courts. The 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals tracks every general civil case concluded by bench or jury trial in 2001 in the 46 surveyed counties that were subsequently appealed to an intermediate appellate court or court of last resort. In the 2001 Civil Justice Survey of State Courts information was collected for every general civil trial concluded in 43 of the 46 selected counties. In these counties, the 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals collected information on all general trials that produced an appeal. In the three remaining counties, (Cook County, Philadelphia County, and Bergen County), the appeals survey obtained information for both those general civil trials concluded in 2001 that were subsequently appealed and, in addition, collected information for those general civil appeals that were not captured at the trial court level. The 2001 Supplemental Survey of Civil Appeals tracks data on general civil appeals that originated from 46 of the nation's 75 most populous counties. Unlike the 2001 Civil Justice Survey of State Courts, cases were not weighted to represent appeals in the nation's 75 most populous counties. The appeals were followed until they were withdrawn, dismissed, or decided on the merits in the appellate courts. All appeals were tracked until April 30, 2005. Appeals not disposed on that date are identified as pending.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey: MSA Data, 1979-2004","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously the National Crime Survey (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The survey is administered by the United States Census Bureau (under the United States Department of Commerce) on behalf of the Bureau of Justice Statistics (under the United States Department of Justice). Occasionally there have been extract or supplement files created from the NCVS and NCS data series. This extract contains two data files, a weighted person-based file, and a weighted incident-based file, which contain the \"core\" counties within the top 40 National Crime Victimization Survey Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs). Core counties within these MSAs are defined as those self-representing primary sampling units that are common to the MSA definitions determined by the Office of Management and Budget for the 1970-based, 1980-based, and 1990-based sample designs. Each MSA is comprised of only the core counties and not all counties within the MSA. The person-based file contains select household and person variables for all people in NCVS-interviewed households in the core counties of the 40 largest MSAs from January 1979 through December 2004. The incident-based file contains select household, person, and incident variables for persons who reported a violent crime within any of the core counties of the 40 largest MSAs from January 1979 through December 2004. Household, person, and incident information for persons reporting non-violent crime are excluded from this file. The 40 largest MSAs were determined based on the number of household interviews in an MSA.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2007-01-15T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Prosecutors Survey, 2005","description":"The National Survey of Prosecutors is a biennial survey of chief prosecutors in state court systems. A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The survey's purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. The data collection instrument was based on questions that were included in the NATIONAL PROSECUTORS SURVEY, 1994 (ICPSR 6785), and added queries on topics of current concern. Variables cover staffing, workload, funding, what type of computer access the office had, whether the office was part of an integrated computerized system with other specific criminal agencies, the use of DNA evidence in plea negotiations of felony trials, which laboratories performed these DNA analyses, juvenile matters, and risks associated with the role of the prosecutor, such as threatening letters or calls, face-to-face assaults, or batter/assaults. The unit of analysis is the district office.","keyword":["attorneys","case processing","criminal investigations","district attorneys","DNA fingerprinting","evidence","felony courts","felony offenses","juvenile courts","personnel","plea negotiations","policies and procedures","prosecuting attorneys","prosecution","sentencing","state courts","training","treatment programs","trial procedures","victim services"],"modified":"2007-02-23T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 1992-2005: Concatenated Incident-Level Files","description":"This data collection is an extract created from the individual years of the National Crime Victimization Survey. Each record contains information on a crime incident occurring in the given calendar year. Part 1 contains all crime incidents, and data Part 2 contains the crimes of rape and attempted rape only. The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2008-12-16T13:56:19Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 1992-1999","description":"The National Crime Victimization Surveys (NCVS) series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes cover rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes cover burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft) as well as personal crimes against him- or herself. The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2013-09-18T13:16:29Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Prosecutors Survey, 1994","description":"The National Survey of Prosecutors is a biennial survey of chief prosecutors in state court systems. A chief prosecutor is an official, usually locally elected and typically with the title of district attorney or county attorney, who is in charge of a prosecutorial district made up of one or more counties, and who conducts or supervises the prosecution of felony cases in a state court system. Prosecutors in courts of limited jurisdiction, such as municipal prosecutors, were not included in the survey. The survey's purpose was to obtain detailed descriptive information on prosecutors' offices, as well as information on their policies and practices. The data collection instrument was based on questions that were included in the NATIONAL PROSECUTORS SURVEY, 1992 (ICPSR 6273), and also added queries on topics of current concern, including: cross-designation of state prosecutors to try cases in federal court, juvenile transfers to criminal court, personal liability insurance for prosecutors, and involvement with community-based drug abuse programs. Variables include whether certain categories of felony prosecution, such as gangs, hate crimes, domestic violence, stalking, fraud, or child abuse or abduction were handled, whether DNA evidence, videotape, expert or child witnesses, polygraph tests, or wiretap evidence were used in trials, types of intermediate sanctions used, including house arrest, electronic monitoring, work release, substance abuse rehabilitation or therapy, community service, and fines or restitution, information on problem cases, personal risks associated with the role of the prosecutor, civil actions against prosecutors, criminal defense of indigent offenders, staffing, workload, funding, whether the defendant's criminal history was used in trials, juvenile matters, relationships with victims and other persons aiding prosecution, computerization, and community leadership. The unit of analysis is the district office.","keyword":["attorneys","case processing","district attorneys","evidence","felony courts","felony offenses","juvenile courts","plea negotiations","policies and procedures","prosecuting attorneys","prosecution","sentencing","state courts","treatment programs","trial procedures"],"modified":"2005-11-04T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Surveys: National Sample, 1973-1983","description":"The National Crime Survey (NCS), a study of personal and household victimization, measures victimization for six selected crimes, including attempts. The NCS was designed to achieve three primary objectives: to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to police, and to provide uniform measures of selected types of crime. The surveys cover the following types of crimes, including attempts: rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto or motor vehicle theft. Crimes such as murder, kidnapping, shoplifting, and gambling are not covered. Questions designed to obtain data on the characteristics and circumstances of the victimization were asked in each incident report. Items such as time and place of occurrence, injuries suffered, medical expenses incurred, number, age, race, and sex of offender(s), relationship of offender(s) to victim (stranger, casual acquaintance, relative, etc.), and other detailed data relevant to a complete description of the incident were included. Legal and technical terms, such as assault and larceny, were avoided during the interviews. Incidents were later classified in more technical terms based upon the presence or absence of certain elements. In addition, data were collected in the study to obtain information on the victims' education, migration, labor force status, occupation, and income. Full data for each year are contained in Parts 101-110. Incident-level extract files (Parts 1-10, 41) are available to provide users with files that are easy to manipulate. The incident-level datasets contain each incident record that appears in the full sample file, the victim's person record, and the victim's household information. These data include person and household information for incidents only. Subsetted person-level files also are available as Parts 50-79. All of the variables for victims are repeated for a maximum of four incidents per victim. There is one person-level subset file for each interview quarter of the complete national sample from 1973 through the second interview quarter in 1980.","keyword":["census data","crime","criminal justice system","demographic characteristics","households","neighborhoods","residential environment","victimization"],"modified":"1998-10-05T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Surveys: Cities Attitude Sub-Sample, 1972-1975","description":"This subsample of the national crime surveys consists of data on personal and household victimization for persons aged 12 and older in 26 major United States cities in the period 1972-1975. The National Crime Surveys were designed by the Bureau of Justice Statistics to meet three primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the numbers and types of crimes not reported to police, and (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes in order to permit reliable comparisons over time and between areas. The surveys provide measures of victimization on the basis of six crimes (including attempts): rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and motor vehicle theft. The total National Crime Survey employed two distinct samples: a National Sample, and a Cities Sample. The cities sample consists of information about victimization in 26 major United States cities. The data collection was conducted by the United States Census Bureau, initial processing of the data and documentation was performed by the Data Use and Access Laboratories (DUALabs), and subsequent processing was performed by the ICPSR under grants from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). This Cities Attitude Sub-Sample study also includes information on personal attitudes and perceptions of crime and the police, the fear of crime, and the effect of this fear on behavioral patterns such as choice of shopping areas and places of entertainment. Data are provided on reasons for respondents' choice of neighborhood, and feelings about neighborhood, crime, personal safety, and the local police. Also specified are date, type, place, and nature of the incidents, injuries suffered, hospital treatment and medical expenses incurred, offender's personal profile, relationship of offender to victim, property stolen and value, items recovered and value, insurance coverage, and police report and reasons if incident was not reported to the police. Demographic items cover age, sex, marital status, race, ethnicity, education, employment, family income, and previous residence and reasons for migrating. This subsample is a one-half random sample of the Complete Sample, NATIONAL CRIME SURVEYS: CITIES, 1972-1975 (ICPSR 7658), in which an attitude questionnaire was administered. The subsample contains data from the same 26 cities that were used in the Complete Sample.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","census data","cities","crime","criminal justice system","larceny","police protection","rape","robbery","victimization"],"modified":"2006-01-12T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Jail Census, 1988","description":"NATIONAL JAIL CENSUS, 1988, is the fifth in a series of data collection efforts aimed at studying the nation's locally administered jails. For purposes of this data collection, a jail was defined as a confinement facility intended for holding adults (and in some cases juveniles) pending adjudication or having sentences of a year or less. Jails were further defined as being administered and staffed by municipal or county employees. Also included in this collection were six jails privately operated under contract for local governments. Excluded from the census were federal or state-administered facilities, including the combined jail-prison systems in Alaska, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, and Vermont. The mailing list used for the census was derived from data gathered from the AMERICAN CORRECTIONAL ASSOCIATION DIRECTORY OF JUSTICE AGENCIES, publications such as AMERICAN JAILS, telephone calls to large metropolitan jail systems (e.g., New York City), state jail inspection bureaus, and newspaper articles. Following the initial mailout to 3,448 facilities, 44 jails were added and 176 deleted according to the criteria for inclusion, leaving a total of 3,316 facilities in 44 states. Variables include information on jail population by legal status, age and sex of prisoners, maximum sentence, admissions and releases, available services, structure and capacity, expenditure, and employment.","keyword":["census data","correctional facilities","correctional system","corrections management","demographic characteristics","inmate populations","inmates","jail inmates","jails"],"modified":"2005-11-04T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Prosecutors Survey, 1990","description":"This survey queried chief prosecuting attorneys of state prosecutorial districts (district attorneys, commonwealth attorneys, etc.) about the prosecution of felony cases within their jurisdictions during 1989-1990. Questions regarding the prefiling, filing, and pretrial stages of felony prosecution asked about policies limiting the time for plea negotiations, the role of the grand jury, how felony cases were screened, and the amount of time that usually elapsed before the prosecutor was notified of persons arrested for a felony. Prosecutors were also asked to report the percentage of court case filings by grand jury indictment, by information following a preliminary hearing, or by other means, and the percentage of felony cases processed by a court of general jurisdiction, a felony court, or other court(s). The trial stage of felony prosecution was covered by questions about the conduct of voir dire examination of prospective jurors, limits on time allowed to commence trial, the number of permitted peremptory challenges, who was responsible for notifying government witnesses to appear in court, whether the prosecution had the right to request a jury trial, whether the jurisdiction's felony court discouraged motions on trial date that would delay trial, and whether the felony court normally granted a continuance on trial date to permit additional time for plea negotiations. Questions on felony sentencing and appeals asked whether the prosecutor was usually present at felony sentence proceedings, whether the judge usually ordered a presentence report, whether victim information was requested or provided by the court, whether the prosecutor normally recommended a type or duration of sentence to be imposed, whether police, victims, or witnesses were notified of the disposition of felony cases, whether the prosecutor was involved in various types of appellate work, and whether the prosecutor had any right of appeal from rulings on motions, from sentences, and from determination of guilt or innocence. General information gathered by the survey includes the number of jurisdictions contained in the prosecutorial district, the number of attorneys and investigators employed in the sampled jurisdiction and in the prosecutorial district as a whole, the length of the prosecutor's term of office, the number of law enforcement agencies that brought arrests into the jurisdiction's court, how much of the prosecutor's felony caseload was assigned on a vertical basis, the kinds of nonfelony matters the prosecutor had responsibility for or jurisdiction over (e.g., family and domestic relations, mental commitments, environmental protection, traffic, etc.), whether the office of prosecutor was an elective position, and whether it was a full- or part-time position. Other general items include whether any felony defendants were provided an attorney on the grounds of indigency, whether, in criminal cases involving both state and federal jurisdiction, the prosecutor would ordinarily be cross-designated to represent the prosecutor in both courts, whether the prosecutor's office contained a \"career criminal\" unit, whether the state's attorney general was entitled to try cases in the jurisdiction's felony court, which types of criminal history data normally were of practical value in felony prosecution, and who supervised the probationer in most cases of adult felons sentenced to probation.","keyword":["attorneys","case processing","district attorneys","evidence","felony courts","felony offenses","plea negotiations","policies and procedures","prosecuting attorneys","prosecution","sentencing","state courts","trial procedures"],"modified":"2005-11-04T00:00:00Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

To evaluate the 75 largest counties in the nation, 33 counties were chosen. The ranking of these counties was based on a combination of crime data and population data. The criteria for including a case on a roster from which cases would be sampled was that (1) one or more defendants must have been arrested for murder and (2) the case must have been adjudicated during 1988. These cases were a sample of about half of all those in the 33 counties studied that had a murder charge brought to the prosecutors in 1988, or earlier, and that were disposed during 1988. When statistically weighted, the sample cases represent a total of 9,576 murder defendants in the nation's 75 largest counties. Demographic information on victims and defendants includes sex, date of birth, area of residence, and occupation.

The SVS asks questions related to victims' experiences of unwanted contact or harassing behavior on two or more occasions during the previous 12 months. The survey provides information about the following dimensions of stalking behavior: relationship of the perpetrator to victim; onset, duration, and desistance; other crimes and injuries committed against the victim in conjunction with stalking; victim response; criminal justice response; and cost to victim. These responses are linked to the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) survey instrument responses for a more complete understanding of the stalking victim's circumstances. The 2006 SVS was a one-time supplement to the annual NCVS to obtain specific information about stalking victimization on a national level. This supplement was sponsored by the Office of Violence Against Women (OVW) in the United States Department of Justice. Since the SVS is a supplement to the NCVS, it is conducted under the authority of Title 42, United States Code, Section 3732.

{"title":"Census of Jail Inmates: Individual-Level Data, 2005","description":"The Census of Jail Inmates is the eighth in a series of data collection efforts aimed at studying the nation's locally-administered jails. Beginning in 2005, the National Jail Census was broken out into two collections. The 2005 Census of Jail Inmates (CJI) collects data on the facilities' supervised populations, inmate counts and movements, and persons supervised in the community. The forthcoming 2006 Census of Jail Facilities collects information on staffing levels, programming, and facility policies. Previous censuses were conducted in 1970, 1972, 1978, 1983, 1988, 1993, and 1999. The 2005 CJI enumerated 2,960 locally administered confinement facilities that held inmates beyond arraignment and were staffed by municipal or county employees. Among these were 42 privately-operated jails under contract to local governments and 65 regional jails that were operated for two or more jail authorities. In addition, the census identified 12 facilities maintained by the Federal Bureau of Prisons that functioned as jails. These 12 facilities, together with the 2,960 nonfederal facilities, brought the number of jails in operation on June 30, 2005, to a nationwide total of 2,972. The CJI supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, crowding issues, growth in the population supervised in the community, and changes in methods of community supervision. The CJI also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-United States citizens in custody.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey: Unbounded Data, 2005 [Record-Type Files]","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey: Unbounded Data (also referred to as the All Rotations Data) are now being made available to the public for analytic use. These data differ from the \"regular\" National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data in that they contain the first interview with respondents. The National Crime Victimization Survey Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2011-06-03T09:47:06Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2008-07-27T11:44:18Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The data were collected to examine change and stability in the operations of crime laboratories serving federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first surveyed forensic crime laboratories in 1998, focusing solely on agencies that performed DNA analysis. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection, called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. Data were collected from 2003 to 2004 on the organization, functions, budget, staffing, workload, and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2002. A total of 306 of the 351 crime laboratories operating in 2002 responded to the census. The latest census obtained data from 351 of the 389 laboratories operating in 2005, including at least 1 laboratory from every state. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2005, including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The 2005 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets, personnel, accreditations, and backlogged cases.","keyword":["budgets","crime laboratories","criminal investigations","DNA fingerprinting","expenditures","forensic sciences","personnel","policies and procedures"],"modified":"2008-10-24T13:33:38Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing, due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 4.1-4.5 and 5.1-5.6. Variables containing information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary.

This study expands on the 1992, 1996, and 2001 CJSSC by collecting a nationally representative sample of bench and jury trials concluded in 156 urban, suburban, and rural counties. Prior iterations of the CJSSC focused on general civil cases concluded by bench or jury trial in a sample of the nation's 75 most populous counties. The 2005 CJSSC was designed and carried out by the National Center for State Courts. Westat designed the national sampling framework for this survey. The data collection produced two datasets. The first contains information on general civil (tort, contract, and real property) cases disposed of by bench or jury trial in a national sample of counties in 2005. Detailed case level information was obtained on these trials, including types of civil cases litigated at trial, characteristics of litigants involved in trials, who wins in trials, compensatory award amounts, punitive damages, case processing times, and post-trial litigation. The other data file contains aggregate information on the number of general civil trial and nontrial dispositions that occurred in 2005 in CJSCC counties that had the capacity to provide these data. This is the fourth in a series of data collections begun in 1992 [CIVIL JUSTICE SURVEY OF STATE COURTS, 1992 (ICPSR 6587), CIVIL JUSTICE SURVEY OF STATE COURTS, 1996 (ICPSR 2883), and CIVIL JUSTICE SURVEY OF STATE COURTS, 2001 (ICPSR 3957)].","keyword":["case processing","civil courts","civil law","court cases","court system","disposition (legal)","lawsuits","state courts"],"modified":"2011-11-02T16:04:45Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction.

As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 1996 [United States]","description":"These data contain records of criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 1996. It is estimated that over 90 percent of felony defendants in the federal criminal justice system are sentenced pursuant to the SRA of 1984. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","keyword":["administration","court cases","criminal law","defendants","federal courts","judicial decisions","legal systems","sentencing guidelines","trial courts"],"modified":"2011-03-08T10:11:14Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction.

The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations.

In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 1998 [United States]","description":"These data contain records of criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 1998. It is estimated that over 90 percent of felony defendants in the federal criminal justice system are sentenced pursuant to the SRA of 1984. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","keyword":["administration","court cases","criminal law","defendants","federal courts","judicial decisions","legal systems","sentencing guidelines","trial courts"],"modified":"2011-03-08T10:32:45Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction.

These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 2000 [United States]","description":"These data contain records of criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 2000. It is estimated that over 90 percent of felony defendants in the federal criminal justice system are sentenced pursuant to the SRA of 1984. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","keyword":["administration","court cases","criminal law","defendants","federal courts","judicial decisions","legal systems","sentencing guidelines","trial courts"],"modified":"2011-03-08T10:54:29Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Statutes for Counts of Convictions for Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 2005","description":"These data contain records of statutes for each count of conviction for criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 2005. The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction.

These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 2002 [United States]","description":"These data contain records of criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 2002. It is estimated that over 90 percent of felony defendants in the federal criminal justice system are sentenced pursuant to the SRA of 1984. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","keyword":["administration","court cases","criminal law","defendants","federal courts","judicial decisions","legal systems","sentencing guidelines","trial courts"],"modified":"2011-03-08T11:16:14Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Statutes for Counts of Convictions for Defendants Sentenced Under the Sentencing Reform Act, 2007","description":"These data contain records of statutes for each count of conviction for criminal defendants who were sentenced pursuant to provisions of the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA) of 1984 and reported to the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC) during fiscal year 2007. The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of counts of conviction for that defendant, and that total is recorded in the NOCOUNT variable. As an example, if a defendant has five counts of conviction (NOCOUNT=5), he or she will have five records in the current data. As it is possible for defendants to have multiple statutes applying to a single count of conviction, up to three statutes (STA1 - STA3) are recorded for each count of conviction. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Defendants in Federal Criminal Cases in District Court -- Pending, 2004 [United States]","description":"The data contain records of defendants in criminal cases filed in United States District Court before or during fiscal year 2004 and still pending as of year-end. The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States District Courts' (AOUSC) criminal file. Defendants in criminal cases may be either individuals or corporations. There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing, due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 4.1-4.5 and 5.1-5.6. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals.

The data include commitments of United States District Court, violators of conditions of release (e.g., parole, probation, or supervised release violators), offenders convicted in other courts (e.g., military or District of Columbia courts), and persons admitted to prison as material witnesses or for purposes of treatment, examination, or transfer to another authority. Records of offenders who exit federal prison temporarily, such as for transit to another location, to serve a weekend sentence, or for health care, are not included in the exiting cohort. These data include variables that describe the offender, such as age, race, citizenship, as well as variables that describe the sentences and expected prison terms. The data file contains original variables from the Bureau of Prisons' SENTRY database, as well as \"SAF\" variables that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 7.9-7.16. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security Number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals.

The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

There is one record for each defendant in each case filed. Included in the records are data from court proceedings and offense codes for up to five offenses charged at the time the case was filed. (The most serious charge at termination may differ from the most serious charge at case filing, due to plea bargaining or action of the judge or jury.) In a case with multiple charges against the defendant, a \"most serious\" offense charge is determined by a hierarchy of offenses based on statutory maximum penalties associated with the charges. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 4.1-4.5 and 5.1-5.6. Variables containing identifying information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

The 2007 Annual Survey of Jails is the 20th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2007. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including Federal and State agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is June 29, 2007.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional system","demographic characteristics","jail inmates","jails","population characteristics","probation"],"modified":"2010-01-27T07:53:48Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey: Unbounded Data, 2006 [Record-Type Files]","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey: Unbounded Data (also referred to as the All Rotations Data) are now being made available to the public for analytic use. These data differ from the \"regular\" National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) data in that they contain the first interview with respondents. The National Crime Victimization Survey Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2011-06-03T10:19:56Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

An additional role following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks is the provision of essential homeland security functions, such as providing critical facility checks of buildings, ports and harbors, public utilities, inland waterways, oil refineries, bridges and spans, water storage/reservoirs, National and/or State monuments, water treatment plants, irrigation facilities, airports, and natural resources. Aviation units are thought to be able to perform critical facility checks and routine patrol and support operations with greater efficiency than ground-based personnel. However, little is presently known about the equipment, personnel, operations, expenditures, and safety requirements of these units on a national level. This information is critical to law enforcement policy development, planning, and budgeting at all levels of government. The data will supply law enforcement agencies with a benchmark for comparative analysis with other similarly situated agencies, and increase understanding of the support that aviation units provide to ground-based police operations.","keyword":["aircraft","law enforcement","national security","police equipment"],"modified":"2009-12-07T07:42:47Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Census of Jail Facilities, 2006","description":"To reduce respondent burden and improve data quality and timeliness, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) split the jail census into two parts: The Census of Jail Inmates was conducted with a reference date of June 30, 2005. The following spring it was followed by this enumeration, the Census of Jail Facilities, which collected data as of March 31, 2006. Previous jail enumerations were conducted in 1970 (ICPSR 7641), 1972 (ICPSR 7638), 1978 (ICPSR 7737), 1983 (ICPSR 8203), 1988 (ICPSR 9256), 1993 (ICPSR 6648), and 1999 (ICPSR 3318). The United States Census Bureau collected the data for the Bureau of Justice Statistics. The 2006 Census of Jail Facilities gathered data from all jail detention facilities holding inmates beyond arraignment, a period normally exceeding 72 hours. Jail facilities were operated by cities and counties, by private entities under contract to correctional authorities, and by the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Excluded from the census were physically separate temporary holding facilities such as drunk tanks and police lockups that do not hold persons after being formally charged in court. Also excluded were state-operated facilities in Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Alaska, which have combined jail-prison systems. Fifteen independently operated jails in Alaska were included in the Census. The census collected jurisdictional level information on the number of confined inmates; average daily population; number of separate jail facilities; renovation and building plans; court orders and consent decrees; staff by occupational category and race/ethnicity; jail programs; and costs of operation. The census also collected individual jail facility information on the purpose for which the jail held offenders; gender of the inmates authorized to house; functions, such as general adult population confinement, work release, and medical treatment; whether a separate temporary holding area or lockup was operated; rated capacity; number of confined inmates by gender and adult or juvenile status; year of original construction; and whether the facility ever had a major renovation.","keyword":["census data","correctional facilities","correctional officers","correctional system","corrections management","demographic characteristics","inmate populations","inmate programs","inmates","jail inmates","jails","personnel"],"modified":"2010-01-26T16:16:17Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2008 Annual Survey of Jails is the 21st such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2008. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 2009","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2011-07-11T15:59:51Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Annual Survey of Jails: Jail-Level Data, 2009","description":"The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) is the only data collection effort that provides an annual source of data on local jails and jail inmates. Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2009 Annual Survey of Jails is the 22nd such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2009. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is June 30, 2009.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional system","demographic characteristics","jail inmates","jails","population characteristics","probation"],"modified":"2011-05-11T11:32:42Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File. The Standardized Research Data File consists of variables from the Monitoring Department's database, which is limited to those defendants whose records have been furnished to the USSC by United States district courts and United States magistrates, as well as variables created by the OPA specifically for research purposes. The data include variables from the Judgement and Conviction (J and C) order submitted by the court, background and guideline information collected from the Presentencing Report (PSR), and the report on sentencing hearing in the Statement of Reasons (SOR). These data contain detailed information such as the guideline base offense level, offense level adjustments, criminal history, departure status, statement of reasons given for departure, and basic demographic information. These data are the primary analysis file and include only statute, guideline computation, and adjustment variables for the most serious offense of conviction.

The data are one of two supplementary files that should be used in conjunction with the primary analysis file, which contains records for all defendants sentenced under the guidelines. These data can be linked to the primary analysis file using the unique identifier variable USSCIDN. The number of records for a defendant in the current data corresponds to the total number of guideline computations, which may or may not equal the total counts of conviction for that defendant, dependent upon the grouping rules of the particular guideline in question (see Section 3D1.2 of the guidelines manual). As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense. The data were obtained from the United States Sentencing Commission's Office of Policy Analysis' (OPA) Standardized Research Data File.

{"title":"Census of Public Defender Offices: State Programs, 2007","description":"The Bureau of Justice Statistics' (BJS) 2007 Census of Public Defender Offices (CPDO) collected data from public defender offices located across 49 states and the District of Columbia. Public defender offices are one of three methods through which states and localities ensure that indigent defendants are granted the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel. (In addition to defender offices, indigent defense services may also be provided by court-assigned private counsel or by a contract system in which private attorneys contractually agree to take on a specified number of indigent defendants or indigent defense cases.) Public defender offices have a salaried staff of full- or part-time attorneys who represent indigent defendants and are employed as direct government employees or through a public, nonprofit organization. Public defenders play an important role in the United States criminal justice system. Data from prior BJS surveys on indigent defense representation indicate that most criminal defendants rely on some form of publicly provided defense counsel, primarily public defenders. Although the United States Supreme Court has mandated that the states provide counsel for indigent persons accused of crime, documentation on the nature and provision of these services has not been readily available. States have devised various systems, rules of organization, and funding mechanisms for indigent defense programs. While the operation and funding of public defender offices varies across states, public defender offices can be generally classified as being part of either a state program or a county-based system. The 22 state public defender programs functioned entirely under the direction of a central administrative office that funded and administered all the public defender offices in the state. For the 28 states with county-based offices, indigent defense services were administered at the county or local jurisdictional level and funded principally by the county or through a combination of county and state funds. The CPDO collected data from both state- and county-based offices. All public defender offices that were principally funded by state or local governments and provided general criminal defense services, conflict services, or capital case representation were within the scope of the study. Federal public defender offices and offices that provided primarily contract or assigned counsel services with private attorneys were excluded from the data collection. In addition, public defender offices that were principally funded by a tribal government, or provided primarily appellate or juvenile services were outside the scope of the project and were also excluded. The CPDO gathered information on public defender office staffing, expenditures, attorney training, standards and guidelines, and caseloads, including the number and type of cases received by the offices. The data collected by the CPDO can be compared to and analyzed against many of the existing national standards for the provision of indigent defense services.","keyword":["defendants","expenditures","law enforcement agencies","legal representation","personnel","police departments","policies and procedures","public defenders"],"modified":"2011-05-13T10:50:57Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

Law enforcement agencies are often the first line of response to the gang problems experienced across the country and are a critical component of most anti-gang initiatives. One way for law enforcement agencies to address gang-related problems is to form specialized gang units. The consolidation of an agency's gang enforcement activities and resources into a single unit can allow gang unit officers to develop specific expertise and technical skills related to local gang characteristics and behaviors and gang prevention and suppression. No prior studies have collected data regarding the organization and operations of law enforcement gang units nationwide, the types of gang prevention tactics employed, or the characteristics and training of gang unit officers. This CLEGU collected data on the operations, workload, policies, and procedures of gang units in large state and local law enforcement agencies in order to expand knowledge of gang prevention and enforcement tactics. The CLEGU also collected summary measures of gang activity in the agencies' jurisdictions to allow for comparison across jurisdictions with similar gang problems.","keyword":["gangs","law enforcement agencies","personnel","police departments","policies and procedures"],"modified":"2011-03-22T16:21:43Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Corrections Reporting Program, 2006","description":"The National Corrections Reporting Program gathers data on prisoners entering and leaving the custody or supervision of state and federal authorities. The dataset is comprised of four types of data: prisoners who were admitted to prison (Part 1), released from prison (Part 2), released from parole (Part 3), or in prison at year end (Part 4). The National Prison Statistics (NPS) program was established in 1926 by the Bureau of the Census in response to a congressional mandate to compile national information on the populations confined in correctional institutions. This program described the characteristics and counts of prison inmates during each calendar year. Since its initiation, responsibility for this program has shifted among several agencies -- in 1950 it was transferred to the Federal Bureau of Prisons and to the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration in 1971. Since 1972, the Bureau of Census, under agreement with the Department of Justice, has had responsibility for compiling the statistical data. Census staff negotiates directly with each state, assembles and edits the data, and prepares the data for analysis and publication.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional facilities (juveniles)","correctional system","demographic characteristics","federal correctional facilities","jail inmates","juvenile offenders","national crime statistics (USA)","offenders","offenses","parole","prison inmates","probation","state correctional facilities"],"modified":"2012-03-01T10:17:47Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Paired-Agency Linked Files, 2010","description":"The new FJSRC linking system, implemented with the 2008 FJSRC data, includes sets of agency dyad linked files created by improved methods of algorithmic matching. There are both inter-agency linked files and intra-agency dyad linked files. The inter-agency matched pair files (or 'dyads') permit the linking of records from two different source agencies for adjacent stages of federal case processing by providing a crosswalk of the agency-specific key ID variables for the two agency data files in the pair. These agency ID variables (sequential ID numbers) may be used to link records from one agency's standard analysis file (SAF) to the next. The system enables users to track individual defendant-cases through stages of the federal criminal justice system (from arrest to prosecution, adjudication, sentencing, and corrections) sequentially, one agency dyad pair at a time. Each inter-agency paired linked file relates the sequential record numbers (i.e. SEQ_NUM) included in the SAFs from one agency/stage to another. The intra-agency matched pair files (also dyads) permit the same type of linking as described above except that the linkages are within the same federal agency. The linkages are to different stages of case processing withing a particular agency. The system covers all data years from 1994-2010. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, D.C.) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Data and documentation were prepared by the Urban Institute.","keyword":["case processing","federal courts","federal offenses"],"modified":"2013-05-17T12:23:52Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

As an example, a defendant with five counts of drug trafficking will only have one guideline computation because each of the drug weights for each count are simply added together and only one calculation is necessary. However, if a defendant has five counts of bank robbery, he or she will have five separate guideline computations because bank robbery is considered to be a nongroupable offense.

{"title":"Federal Justice Statistics Program: Criminal Appeals Cases in Courts of Appeals -- Terminated, 2009 [United States]","description":"The data contain records of criminal appeals cases terminated in United States Courts of Appeals during fiscal year 2009. The data were constructed from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts' (AOUSC) Court of Appeals file. These contain variables on the nature of the criminal appeal, the underlying offense, and the disposition of the appeal. An appeal can be filed by the government or the offender, and the appellant can appeal the sentence, the verdict, or both sentence and verdict. Appeals may be terminated on the merits or on procedural grounds. Of those that are terminated on the merits, the district court ruling may be affirmed, reversed, remanded to criminal court, or dismissed. The data file contains variables from the original AOUSC files as well as additional analysis variables, or \"SAF\" variables, that denote subsets of the data. These SAF variables are related to statistics reported in the Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics, Tables 6.1-6.5. Variables containing information (e.g., name, Social Security number) were replaced with blanks, and the day portions of date fields were also sanitized in order to protect the identities of individuals. These data are part of a series designed by the Urban Institute (Washington, DC) and the Bureau of Justice Statistics.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 2010","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2012-06-22T09:23:50Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Annual Survey of Jails: Jail-Level Data, 2010","description":"The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) is the only data collection effort that provides an annual source of data on local jails and jail inmates. Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2010 Annual Survey of Jails is the 23rd such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex. Also new to 2010, data is collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity. Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails. To address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails. In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2010. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is June 30, 2010.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional system","demographic characteristics","jail inmates","jails","population characteristics","probation"],"modified":"2011-08-02T14:36:32Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Former Prisoner Survey, 2008","description":"Under the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003, Congress mandated that the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) investigate former prisoners' experiences in prison to assist in understanding the incidence and prevalence of sexual victimization within the prison setting. BJS and its subcontractor, NORC at the University of Chicago, led a national data collection effort focusing on prison sexual assault as reported by former state prisoners. The focus of the National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) was sexual victimization among former state prisoners. The survey was divided into 6 sections. The first two sections were administered using a computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) method and focused on demographic and criminal history information. The remaining sections, covering more sensitive information, were administered using a touch-screen-audio-assisted-computer-self-interviewing (TACASI) method. Sections A and B of the instrument collected demographic and criminal history information, as well as information on placements during the last continuous incarceration. Sections C and D captured detailed inmate-on-inmate sexual victimization during the last continuous incarceration, including the type of sexual activity, identification of facilities at which such incidents occurred, frequency of occurrences, and other specifics regarding sexual victimization. Section E addressed staff-on-inmate sexual victimization and misconduct, whether considered willing or unwilling, and gathered specifics of activity indicated. The last section, F, focused on the impacts of sexual assault on victimized respondents, as well as parole supervision characteristics for all respondents. The National Former Prisoner Survey (NFPS) began in January 2008 and concluded in October 2008, and involved the random selection of approximately 250 parole offices across the country using probability proportional-to-size (PPS) sampling procedures. Completed interviews were obtained for 17,738 respondents; supplemental data was collected on all former prisoners sampled in order to develop weights for national estimations.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional guards","criminal histories","inmates","prison conditions","prison violence","rape","sex offenders","sex offenses","sexual abuse","sexual assault","sexual behavior"],"modified":"2012-08-03T14:33:15Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Annual Survey of Jails: Jail-Level Data, 2011","description":"The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) is the only data collection effort that provides an annual source of data on local jails and jail inmates. Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2011 Annual Survey of Jails is the 24th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex. Also new to the survey, data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity. Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails. To address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails. In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2011. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is June 30, 2011.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional system","demographic characteristics","jail inmates","jails","population characteristics","probation"],"modified":"2012-04-25T09:32:46Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Survey of Youth in Custody, 2008-2009","description":"The National Survey of Youth in Custody (NSYC) is part of the BJS National Prison Rape Statistics Program to gather mandated data on the incidence of prevalence of sexual assault in juvenile facilities under the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 (PREA; P.L. 108-79). The Act requires a 10 percent sample of juvenile facilities to be listed by incidence of sexual assault. Data are collected directly from youth in a private setting using audio computer-assisted self interview (ACASI) technology with a touch-screen laptop and an audio feed to maximize inmate confidentiality and minimize literacy issues. The first year of collection includes nearly 200 juvenile facilities, with an estimated 10,000 completed interviews with youth. The NSYC utilized two questionnaires, based on the age of the respondent. The Older Youth questionnaire was administered to youths ages 15 and older, and the Younger Youth questionnaire was administered to those 14 and younger. The survey was divided into five sections. Section A collected background information, such as details of admission to facility and demographics including education, height, weight, race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and history of any forced sexual contact. Section B, Facility Perceptions and Victimization, included respondents' opinions of the facility and staff, any incidence of gang activity, and any injuries that had occurred. Section C, Sexual Activity Within Facility, captured the types of sexual contact that occurred and the circumstances of sexual contact. Section D, Description of Events with Youth, and Section E, Description of Events with Staff Member, focused on when and where the contact occurred, the race and gender of the other youths or staff members, if threats or coersion were involved, and outcomes, included whether or not the sexual contact was reported. Other variables include debriefing questions about respondents' experiences completing the survey, interviewer observations, created variables to summarize victimization reports (due to the complicated routing in Section C), weight and stratification data, and administrative data about the facilities.","keyword":["correctional facilities (juveniles)","correctional guards","juvenile detention","juvenile inmates","juvenile offenders","juvenile victims","prison conditions","prison violence","rape","sex offenders","sex offenses","sexual abuse","sexual assault","sexual behavior"],"modified":"2013-04-04T10:55:15Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 2011","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\" is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sexual offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2012-10-25T15:41:38Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The DCRP began in 2000 under the Death in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 (P.L. 106-297). It is the only national statistical collection that obtains detailed information about deaths in adult correctional facilities. The DCRP collects data on persons dying in state prisons, local jails and in the process of arrest. Each collection is a separate subcollection, but each is under the umbrella of the DCRP collection. This deals with the prison subcollection, which has a prison death file. The prison portion of the Deaths in Custody Reporting Program began in 2001 after the passage of the Deaths in Custody Reporting Act of 2000 in October of 2000. The prison component of the DCRP collects data on inmate deaths occurring in the 50 state departments of corrections while inmates are in the physical custody of prison officials.","keyword":["correctional facilities","corrections","death","homicide","suicide"],"modified":"2013-07-31T15:33:46Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, 2009","description":"This data collection contains data from censuses of publicly funded crime laboratories in 2009. The data were collected to examine change and stability in the operations of crime laboratories serving federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) first surveyed forensic crime laboratories in 1998, focusing solely on agencies that performed DNA analysis. The National Institute of Justice (NIJ) funded the 1998 study as part of its DNA Laboratory Improvement Program. The BJS' National Study of DNA Laboratories was repeated in 2001. An expanded version of the data collection, called the Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories, was first conducted among all forensic crime laboratories in 2002. For the 2009 study, data were collected from 2010 to 2011 on the organization, functions, budget, staffing, workload, and performance expectations of the nation's forensic crime laboratories operating in 2009. A total of 397 of the 411 eligible crime laboratories operating in 2009 responded to the census, including at least 1 laboratory from every state. The nation's publicly funded forensic crime laboratories performed a variety of forensic services in 2009, including DNA testing and controlled substance identification for federal, state, and local jurisdictions. The 2009 Census of Publicly Funded Forensic Crime Laboratories obtained detailed information on the types of forensic requests received by these laboratories and the resources needed to complete them. The census also collected data on crime laboratory budgets, personnel, accreditations, and backlogged cases.","keyword":["budgets","crime laboratories","criminal investigations","DNA fingerprinting","expenditures","forensic sciences","personnel","policies and procedures"],"modified":"2012-11-26T15:33:04Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

Since 1979, the Census Bureau has been the NPS data collection agent. The NPS is administered to 51 respondents. Before 2001, the District of Columbia was also a respondent, but responsibility for housing the District of Columbia's sentenced prisoners was transferred to the federal Bureau of Prisons, and by yearend 2001 the District of Columbia no longer operated a prison system. The NPS provides an enumeration of persons in state and federal prisons and collects data on key characteristics of the nation's prison population.

{"title":"National Corrections Reporting Program, 2000-2011","description":"The National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP) compiles offender-level data on admissions and releases from state and federal prisons and post-confinement community supervision. The data are used to monitor the nation's correctional population and address specific policy questions related to recidivism, prisoner reentry, and trends in demographic characteristics of the incarcerated and community supervision populations. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) has administered the NCRP since 1983. The United States Bureau of the Census served as data collection agent for BJS until October 2010, when Abt Associates assumed this position. From 2000 to 2009, NCRP data were archived each year in four, year-specific files that corresponded to the four files that states were asked to submit to the Census Bureau. The four files are: Prison Admissions (Part A), Prison Releases (Part B), Parole Exits (Part C), and Prison Custody (Part D). For example, the 2009 NCRP archive consists of prison admissions occurring in 2009, prison releases occurring in 2009, parole exits occurring in 2009, and prisoners in custody on December 31, 2009. Starting in 2011, NCRP data will be archived in a single, multi-year Term Record file. A Term Record represents a single period of incarceration for an individual offender. Each year, the archived Term Record file will be replaced by a new Term Record file that incorporates new NCRP data collected and processed during the previous year, as well as updates to previously collected data. The Term Records were created from the Prison Admissions (Part A), Prison Releases (Part B), and Prison Custody (Part D) records submitted by states since 2000. With a few lines of computing code (included with the archive), an analyst can create a prison admission, release, or custody file from the Term Record file. In addition to the Term Record file, two additional files are being archived: (1) Prison Admissions (Part A), Prison Releases (Part B), and Prison Custody (Part D) records that were not used in building the Term Record file and (2) Part C (Parole Exit) records collected from January 1, 2011 to October 31, 2012.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional facilities (juveniles)","correctional system","demographic characteristics","federal correctional facilities","jail inmates","juvenile offenders","national crime statistics (USA)","offenders","offenses","parole","prison inmates","probation","state correctional facilities"],"modified":"2013-09-23T11:52:04Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"National Crime Victimization Survey, 2012","description":"The National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) Series, previously called the National Crime Surveys (NCS), has been collecting data on personal and household victimization through an ongoing survey of a nationally-representative sample of residential addresses since 1973. The NCVS was designed with four primary objectives: (1) to develop detailed information about the victims and consequences of crime, (2) to estimate the number and types of crimes not reported to the police, (3) to provide uniform measures of selected types of crimes, and (4) to permit comparisons over time and types of areas. The survey categorizes crimes as \"personal\" or \"property.\" Personal crimes include rape and sexual attack, robbery, aggravated and simple assault, and purse-snatching/pocket-picking, while property crimes include burglary, theft, motor vehicle theft, and vandalism. Each respondent is asked a series of screen questions designed to determine whether she or he was victimized during the six-month period preceding the first day of the month of the interview. A \"household respondent\"is also asked to report on crimes against the household as a whole (e.g., burglary, motor vehicle theft). The data include type of crime, month, time, and location of the crime, relationship between victim and offender, characteristics of the offender, self-protective actions taken by the victim during the incident and results of those actions, consequences of the victimization, type of property lost, whether the crime was reported to police and reasons for reporting or not reporting, and offender use of weapons, drugs, and alcohol. Basic demographic information such as age, race, gender, and income is also collected, to enable analysis of crime by various subpopulations. This version of the NCVS, referred to as the collection year, contains records from interviews conducted in the 12 months of the given year.","keyword":["assault","auto theft","burglary","crime","crime costs","crime rates","crime reporting","crime statistics","offenders","offenses","property crimes","rape","reactions to crime","robbery","sex offenses","vandalism","victimization","victims"],"modified":"2013-10-28T11:19:55Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

{"title":"Annual Survey of Jails: Jail-Level Data, 2012","description":"The Annual Survey of Jails (ASJ) is the only data collection effort that provides an annual source of data on local jails and jail inmates. Data on the size of the jail population and selected inmate characteristics are obtained every five to six years from the Census of Jails. In each of the years between the full censuses, a sample survey of jails is conducted to estimate baseline characteristics of the nation's jails and inmates housed in these jails. The 2012 Annual Survey of Jails is the 25th such survey in a series begun in 1982. The ASJ supplies data on characteristics of jails such as admissions and releases, growth in the number of jail facilities, changes in their rated capacities and level of occupancy, growth in the population supervised in the community, changes in methods of community supervision, and crowding issues. The ASJ also provides information on changes in the demographics of the jail population, supervision status of persons held, and a count of non-citizens in custody. Starting in 2010, BJS enhanced the ASJ survey instruments to address topics on the number of convicted inmates that are unsentenced or sentenced and the number of unconvicted inmates awaiting trial/arraignment, or transfers/holds for other authorities. In order to reduce respondent burden, the ASJ no longer collects data on conviction status by sex. Also new to the survey, data are collected on jails' operational capacity and design capacity. Incorporating enhanced capacity measurements enables BJS to describe more accurately the variation and volatility of inmate bed space and crowding, especially as they relate to safety and security in jails. To address more directly issues related to overcrowding and safety and security in jails, BJS started collecting data on staff and assaults against staff from the largest jails. In the modifications to the ASJ, starting in 2010, 335 jail jurisdictions (370 respondents) included with certainty in the ASJ sample survey were asked to provide additional information (forms CJ-5D or CJ-5DA) on the flow of inmates going through jails and the distribution of time served, staff characteristics and assaults on staff resulting in death, and inmate misconduct. The data presented in this study were collected in the Annual Survey of Jails, 2012. These data are used to track growth in the number of jails and the capacities nationally, changes in the demographics of the jail population and supervision status of persons held, the prevalence of crowding issues, and a count of non-United States citizens within the jail population. The data are intended for a variety of users, including federal and state agencies, local officials in conjunction with jail administrators, researchers, planners, and the public. The reference date for the survey is June 29, 2012.","keyword":["correctional facilities","correctional system","demographic characteristics","jail inmates","jails","population characteristics","probation"],"modified":"2013-10-30T09:27:43Z","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The BJS study entitled Processing of Domestic Violence Cases in State Courts collected additional incident-based and case processing data on more than 5,000 felony and misdemeanor domestic violence defendants in 16 of the 40 counties. The personal identifiers supplied by these courts were used to obtain criminal history records on the approximately 20,000 state court defendants.

The extract files version of NIBRS was created to simplify working with NIBRS data. Data management issues with NIBRS are significant, especially when two or more segment levels are being merged. These issues require skills separate from data analysis. NIBRS data as formatted by the FBI are stored in a single file. These data are organized by various segment levels (record types). There are six main segment levels: administrative, offense, property, victim, offender, and arrestee. Each segment level has a different length and layout. There are other segment levels that occur with less frequency than the six main levels. Significant computing resources are necessary to work with the data in its single-file format. In addition, the user must be sophisticated in working with data in complex file types. For these reasons and the desire to facilitate the use of NIBRS data, ICPSR created the extract files. The data are not a representative sample of crime in the United States.","keyword":["arrests, crime","crime rates","crime reporting","law enforcement agencies","national crime statistics (USA)","offenders","offenses","property crime","Uniform Crime Reports","victims, violent crime"],"modified":"2014-01-03","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The data were collected by RTI International under a cooperative agreement with the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). The NIS-2 comprised two questionnaires -- a survey of sexual victimization and a survey of past drug and alcohol use and treatment. Inmates were randomly assigned to receive one of the questionnaires so that at the time of the interview the content of the survey remained unknown to facility staff and the interviewers. A total of 81,566 inmates participated in the survey, including 32,029 inmates in state and federal prisons, 48,066 inmates in jails, 399 inmates in military facilities, 115 inmates in Indian country jails, and 957 inmates in facilities operated by ICE. The respondents were asked about the type of sexual contact, the frequency, when it occurred, and where it occurred. The survey also sought information on any injuries received and the treatment obtained for those injuries. Other questions pertained to the reporting of sexual contact -- if it was reported, to whom it was reported, and any results from reporting sexual contact. Respondents were also asked for reasons why they had not reported the sexual contact if no report was made. Background and demographic information collected includes reasons for incarceration, sexual history, sexual orientation, marital status, gender, ethnicity, and physical characteristics such as height and weight.","keyword":["correctional facilities (adults)","correctional guards","inmates","prison conditions","prison violence","rape","sex offenders","sex offenses","sexual abuse","sexual assault","sexual behavior"],"modified":"2014-01-15","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.

The main NLSY97 data are available for public use and can be accessed online at the NLS Investigator Web site and at the NACJD Web site (as ICPSR 3959). Questionnaires, user guides and other documentation are available at the same links. The National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) was designed by the United States Department of Labor, comprising the National Longitudinal Survey (NLS) Series. Created to be representative of United States residents in 1997 who were born between the years of 1980 and 1984, the NLSY97 documents the transition from school to work experienced by today's youths through data collection from 1997. The majority of the oldest cohort members (age 16 as of December 31, 1996) were still in school during the first survey round and the youngest respondents (age 12) had not yet entered the labor market.","keyword":["arrests","crime","demographic characteristics","educational background","health, income","substance abuse","young adults","youths"],"modified":"2014-02-06","publisher":"United States Department of Justice.
