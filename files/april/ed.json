LEAs submit administrative records about schools in the district. LEAs and BOCES-type regional education centers functioning as LEAs were sampled. Prior to 2011–12, charter schools were primarily sampled if they were part of a LEA, not if they were a separate charter school district. CRDC 2006 achieved an unprecedented 100% response rate for LEAs and a 99.6 % response rate for schools. Key statistics produced from CRDC 2006 can provide information about critical civil rights issues as well as contextual information on the state of civil rights in the nation, including enrollment demographics, advanced placement, discipline, and special education services.",

PIRLS 2006 (http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/pirls/) is a cross-sectional study that provides international comparative information of the reading literacy of fourth-grade students and examines factors that may be associated with the acquisition of reading literacy in young students. The study was conducted using questionnaires and direct assessments of fourth-grade students. In the Unite States a total of 183 schools were sampled and 5,190 fourth-grade students were tested. The final weighted student response rate was 95 percent and the final weighted school response rate was 99 percent. The overall weighted response rate was 82 percent. Key statistics produced from PIRLS 2006 are how well fourth-grade students read, how students in one country compare with students in another country, how much fourth-grade students value and enjoy reading, and internationally, how the reading habits and attitudes of students vary.",

The guidance provides the principles that a school should use to recognize and effectively respond to sexual harassment of students in its program as a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance. This 2011 Dear Colleague Letter on Sexual Violence explains that the requirements of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 cover sexual violence and reminds schools of their responsibilities to take immediate and effective steps to respond to sexual violence in accordance with the requirements of Title IX. This 2013 Dear Colleague Letter on Retaliation reminds school districts, postsecondary institutions, and other recipients that retaliation is also a violation of Federal law. The letter seeks to clarify the basic principles of retaliation law and to describe OCR’s methods of enforcement.",

The study was conducted using multiple sources, including institutional records, government databases, and student interviews. NPSAS:08 contains the data on a sample of 114,000 undergraduate students and 14,000 graduate students. These students were enrolled between July 1, 2007 and June 30, 2008 in about 1,730 postsecondary institutions. The data are representative of all undergraduate and graduate students enrolled in postsecondary institutions in the 50 United States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico that were eligible to participate in the federal financial aid programs in Title IV of the Higher Education Act. Statistics produced from the NPSAS:08 provide reliable national estimates of characteristics related to financial aid for postsecondary students.",

HSTS 2005 (http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/hsts/) is a cross-sectional survey that periodically surveys the curricula being followed in our nation's high schools and the coursetaking patterns of high school students through a collection of transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample included every eligible sampled NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade public school that was contacted for the HSTS, whether or not they actually participated in the NAEP assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample from the NAEP 2005 twelfth-grade private school sample for the mathematics and science assessments. The study was conducted using a survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. Schools participating in the 12th-grade NAEP math and science assessments in 2005 were sampled. The study’s weighted response rate was 84.2 percent. HSTS 2005 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2005 are information about the types of courses that graduates took, how many credits they earned, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

The study was conducted using survey of school administrative personnel and collection of students' transcripts. For public schools, the HSTS sample was a subsample of the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade public school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. For private schools, the HSTS sample was the NAEP 2009 twelfth-grade private school sample for the operational mathematics and science assessments. The study’s weighted response rate was 83 percent. HSTS 2009 also offers information on the relationship of student coursetaking patterns to achievement at grade 12 as measured by NAEP. Key statistics produced from HSTS 2009 are information about the types of courses that graduates take, how many credits they earn, their grade point averages, and the relationship between coursetaking patterns and achievement, as measured by NAEP.",

A review may be initiated when a complaint is received, a media event raises certain concerns, the school's independent audit identifies serious noncompliance, or through a review selection process that may also coincide with state reviews performed by the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Service (CJIS) Audit Unit. Once a review is completed, the Department issues a Final Program Review Determination. Although regular program reviews may contain Clery Act findings, this page includes only those program reviews that were focused exclusively on the Clery Act.",
