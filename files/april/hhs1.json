For persons 44 years of age and younger, TBI-related deaths decreased between the periods of 2001\u20132002 and 2009\u20132010.  Rates for age groups 45\u201364 years of age remained stable for this same ten-year period.

    "description": "In general, total combined rates for traumatic brain injury (TBI)-related emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalizations and deaths have increased over the past decade.  Total combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths climbed slowly from a rate of 521.0 per 100,000 in 2001 to 615.7 per 100,000 in 2005.  The rates then dipped to 595.1 per 100,000 in 2006 and 566.7 per 100,000 in 2007.  The rates then spiked sharply in 2008 and continued to climb through 2010 to a rate of 823.7 per 100,000.  \r\n\r\nTotal combined rates of TBI-related hospitalizations, ED visits, and deaths are driven in large part by the relatively high number of TBI-related ED visits.  In comparison to ED visits, the overall rates of TBI-related hospitalizations remained relatively stable changing from 82.7 per 100,000 in 2001 to 91.7 per 100,000 in 2010.  TBI-related deaths also decreased slightly over time from 18.5 per 100,000 in 2001 to 17.1 per 100,000 in 2010.  Note that the axis scale for TBI-related deaths appears to the right of the chart and differs from TBI-related hospitalizations and ED visits.\r\n\r\nGo to http://www.cdc.gov/traumaticbraininjury/data/index.html to view more TBI data & statistics.",

    "description": "This table contains the list of nationally notifiable diseases for which less than <1,000 cases was reported in the past year.  \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these query tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.\r\n\u2020 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\r\n\u00a7 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx.\r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and\r\nEnteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II.\r\n** Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.\r\n\u2020\u2020 Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Since September 29, 2013, 79 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2013-14 influenza season have been reported.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7 The four measles cases reported for the current week were imported.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.\r\n*** CDC discontinued reporting of individual confirmed and probable cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infections on July 24, 2009. During 2009, four cases of human infection with\r\nnovel influenza A viruses, different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, were reported to CDC. The four cases of novel influenza A virus infection reported to CDC during 2010, the\r\nfourteen cases reported during 2011, the 313 cases reported in 2012, and the 21 cases reported during 2013 are different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Total case counts are\r\nprovided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 No rubella cases were reported for the current week.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 There were no cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported during the current week.

The Purpose of the initiative is to implement community level interventions to promote healthy lifestyles to prevent obesity and type 2 diabetes. Twenty-two communities across New York State are funded to carry out this initiative. From a list of 18 policy, systems and environmental interventions, community contractors selected a minimum four to implement. The 18 interventions are grouped into five, broad activity categories. The activities include two that are related to increasing opportunities for physical activity, two that address improving nutrition, and one that addresses both physical activity and nutrition.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these query tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.\r\n\u2020 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\r\n\u00a7 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx.\r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive.

Since September 29, 2013, 37 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2013-14 influenza season have been reported. Since September 30, 2012, 171 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2012-13 influenza season have been reported.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7 No measles cases were reported for the current week.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.\r\n*** CDC discontinued reporting of individual confirmed and probable cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infections on July 24, 2009. During 2009, four cases of human infection with\r\nnovel influenza A viruses, different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, were reported to CDC. The four cases of novel influenza A virus infection reported to CDC during 2010, the\r\nfourteen cases reported during 2011, the 313 cases reported in 2012, and the 21 cases reported during 2013 are different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Total case counts are\r\nprovided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 No rubella cases were reported for the current week.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 There were no cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported during the current week.

NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these query tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.\r\n\u2020 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\r\n\u00a7 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx.\r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and\r\nEnteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance).

Since September 29, 2013, fifty influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2013-14 influenza season have been reported.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7 The two measles cases reported for the current week were imported.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.\r\n*** CDC discontinued reporting of individual confirmed and probable cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infections on July 24, 2009. During 2009, four cases of human infection with\r\nnovel influenza A viruses, different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, were reported to CDC. The four cases of novel influenza A virus infection reported to CDC during 2010, the\r\nfourteen cases reported during 2011, the 313 cases reported in 2012, and the 21 cases reported during 2013 are different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Total case counts are\r\nprovided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 No rubella cases were reported for the current week.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 There were no cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported during the current week.

    "description": "This table contains the list of nationally notifiable diseases for which less than <1,000 cases was reported in the past year.  \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these query tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts. \r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see  http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/ProvisionalNationaNotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.\r\n\u2020 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years. Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf. \u00a7 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza-associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx. \r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and Enteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II. \r\n** Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II. \r\n\u2020\u2020 Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Since September 29, 2013, 75 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2013-14 influenza season have been reported. \r\n\u00a7\u00a7 Of the five measles cases reported for the current week, one was indigenous and four were imported. \r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II. \r\n*** CDC discontinued reporting of individual confirmed and probable cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infections on July 24, 2009. During 2009, four cases of human infection with novel influenza A viruses, different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, were reported to CDC. The four cases of novel influenza A virus infection reported to CDC during 2010, the fourteen cases reported during 2011, the 313 cases reported in 2012, and the 21 cases reported during 2013 are different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Total case counts are provided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD). \r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 No rubella cases were reported for the current week. \r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention. \r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 There were no cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported during the current week.

    "description": "This table contains the list of nationally notifiable diseases for which less than <1,000 cases was reported in the past year.  \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in these query tables are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available. \r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\u2014: No reported cases. N: Not reportable. NN: Not Nationally Notifiable. Cum: Cumulative year-to-date counts.\r\n* Case counts for reporting years 2013 and 2014 are provisional and subject to change. For further information on interpretation of these data, see http://www.cdc.gov/ncphi/disss/nndss/\r\nphs/files/ProvisionalNationa%20NotifiableDiseasesSurveillanceData20100927.pdf.\r\n\u2020 Calculated by summing the incidence counts for the current week, the 2 weeks preceding the current week, and the 2 weeks following the current week, for a total of 5 preceding years.  Additional information is available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/5yearweeklyaverage.pdf.\r\n\u00a7 Not reportable in all states. Data from states where the condition is not reportable are excluded from this table except starting in 2007 for the arboviral diseases, STD data, TB data, and influenza associated pediatric mortality, and in 2003 for SARS-CoV. Reporting exceptions are available at http://wwwn.cdc.gov/nndss/document/SRCA_FINAL_REPORT_2006-2012_final.xlsx.\r\n\u00b6 Includes both neuroinvasive and nonneuroinvasive. Updated weekly from reports to the Division of Vector-Borne Infectious Diseases, National Center for Zoonotic, Vector-Borne, and\r\nEnteric Diseases (ArboNET Surveillance). Data for West Nile virus are available in Table II.\r\n** Data for H. influenzae (all ages, all serotypes) are available in Table II.\r\n\u2020\u2020 Updated weekly from reports to the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. Since September 29, 2013, 61 influenza-associated pediatric deaths occurring during the 2013-14 influenza season have been reported.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7 The one measles case reported for the current week was imported.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6 Data for meningococcal disease (all serogroups) are available in Table II.\r\n*** CDC discontinued reporting of individual confirmed and probable cases of influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus infections on July 24, 2009. During 2009, four cases of human infection with\r\nnovel influenza A viruses, different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, were reported to CDC. The four cases of novel influenza A virus infection reported to CDC during 2010, the\r\nfourteen cases reported during 2011, the 313 cases reported in 2012, and the 21 cases reported during 2013 are different from the influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 virus. Total case counts are\r\nprovided by the Influenza Division, National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases (NCIRD).\r\n\u2020\u2020\u2020 No rubella cases were reported for the current week.\r\n\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 Updated weekly from reports to the Division of STD Prevention, National Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention.\r\n\u00b6\u00b6\u00b6 There were no cases of viral hemorrhagic fever reported during the current week.

In this Handbook, you will find the basic steps to follow to establish paternity, to obtain a support order, and to collect the support due, whether you are working with your state, local, or tribal child support program or your own attorney. There is information for noncustodial parents about providing financial and emotional support to your children, about keeping in touch with them, and keeping support orders fair.\r\n\r\nAlthough the function of the child support program is to collect and distribute child support payments, throughout the Handbook we hope to give the message that children fare best when both parents play an active, supportive role in their lives.",

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.",

A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

The ICR is a comprehensive compilation of exhibits that have been modified over time that users should consider when using the ICR dataset. It is possible that data is updated subsequent to posting on this website; therefore the data could become obsolete. To get the details related to the exhibits and data elements, please refer to the blank ICR form, the ICR Table of Contents, the ICR Instructions and the Glossary of Terms, Acronyms, and Abbreviations which are in the Supporting Information section of this site. The data posted as edited contains desk edit adjustments by DOH personnel. In 2009, this information was not audited; however effective with the 2010 ICR, all ICRs will be audited by a Certified Public Accounting Firm annually.",

    "description": "This dataset measures the air, water, milk, and fallout at Background sites around NYS to determine the normal levels of radioactivity and monitors the influence of human activities on these levels. Background samples are collected statewide from several sites which are not expected to be influenced by discharges of radionuclides to the environment.  The site numbers represent the location from which samples are collected. This dataset is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation). A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.

The dataset includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high).   The rates of overweight and obesity reported are percentages based on counts of students in selected grades (Pre-K, K, 2, 4, 7, 10) reported to the NYSDOH. Because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.

The Congenital Malformations Registry (CMR) of the New York State Department of Health is a repository for case reports on children who are born or reside in New York State and are diagnosed before the age of two years with any structural, functional or biochemical abnormality determined genetically or induced during gestation and not due to birthing events. This is based on reporting from hospitals which is required under the State Sanitary Code.  Hospitals report a narrative description of the birth defect which is reviewed and coded by CMR staff.

This dataset includes the names and locations of participating day care sites and whether or not the site is Breastfeeding Friendly Certified with CACFP, participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Child Care Settings (EWPHCCS) project, or participating in the Eat Well Play Hard in Day Care Homes (EWPHDCH) project.   This dataset excludes Child and Adult Care Food Program participation provided at homeless shelters and legally-exempt day care home providers.  \r\n\r\nNot all counties in NYS are serviced by the grantees implementing the project EWPHCSS. \r\n\r\nThe EWPHDCH project is currently limited to the areas served by the contracted agencies. \r\n\r\nThe Child and Adult Care Food Program dataset is related to the Child Care Related Programs dataset on the www.Open.ny.gov website, however this dataset includes additional nutrition information.  The Office of Children and Family Services (OCFS) is currently working to update the Child Care Related Programs dataset on a more frequent schedule with the OPEN NY team.  OCFS and DOH will then be able to synchronize in the near future.  Temporarily, DOH has omitted addresses for regulated child care providers that provide home care since this information is available on www.Open.ny.gov by using this link: https://data.ny.gov/Human-Services/Child-Care-Regulated-Programs/cb42-qumz.   \r\n\r\n For more information, please visit http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/nutrition/cacfp/ or go to the \"About\" tab.",

Inspections are a \u201csnapshot\u201d in time and are not always reflective of the day-to-day operations and overall condition of an establishment.

    "description": "The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is an annual statewide telephone surveillance system designed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older. Although the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available. For more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

Not all measures are collected each year. Some services require more resource intensive methods of collection, and these measures are collected every other year to reduce the burden associated with reviewing patient records. Refer to the Health Measures Descriptions document to learn about the specific measures included in this dataset. Measure specification changes and health plan mergers and closures preclude the ability to trend this data over time.

Unfortunately, this finding is typical of both Oklahoma and the US.  On average, Black/African American infants have IMRs 2 to 2.5 times higher than white infants.  This gap has been an enduring health disparity for the state and nation.\r\n\r\n- Hispanics have IMRs that are consistently better than all other racial or ethnic groups.",

Costs were almost 6,000 dollars higher for those who accessed peer support services, mostly for professional services and prescription drugs. While the use of Medicaid peer support may not result in savings from fewer costly crisis stabilizations and psychiatric hospitalizations, it does support the principles of self-direction and recovery. State policy makers must weigh the potential higher cost of peer support programs with efforts to change the delivery of mental health services.\r\n",

    "description": "In a new report, Dr. Dana Mukamel and colleagues reveal their analysis of the costs of home-care agencies. Using Cost Reports and the Home Health Compare (HHC) quality report card 2010 data, they estimated the relationships between total costs, the type of patients served by the agency, its quality of care, and its market environment. They found that while non-profits are much larger than for-profit agencies and have lower costs per patient, they have higher costs per visit. Both types of agencies show diseconomies of scale, suggesting that efficiencies could be achieved if the industry operated smaller scale agencies, increased the salaried nursing staff while it decreased the number of contract nurses, and emphasized patient assessment services. Despite its limitations, this study offers new insights into home-care agencies costs in the Prospective Payment System and HHC era.",

The data reported are estimated based on a biennial survey of custodial parents, the Child Support Supplement to the Current Population Survey, March/April 2012, co-sponsored by the Office of Child Support Enforcement.  The proportion of custodial parents living below poverty line continues to increase in 2011. The report found that 4.2 million custodial parents lived in poverty in 2011, representing 29 percent of all custodial parents, about twice the poverty rate for the total population. These statistics reinforce the essential role that child support services can play in helping low-income families, especially during an economic downturn. ",

The Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act gives states the choice to extend Medicaid Buy-In coverage to a medically improved group, but evidence of participants employment results has been lacking. This study shows that enrollment has been limited, with 233 participants in 2009. However, participation has doubled annually, on average, with a low drop out or churn rate. Participants earnings grew significantly, with mean earnings in 2009 at 52 percent above the federal poverty level.",

Data on United States exclude counts from US territories. \r\n\r\nNote:\r\nThese are provisional cases of selected national notifiable diseases, from the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS). NNDSS data reported by the 50 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories are collated and published weekly as numbered tables printed in the back of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR). Cases reported by state health departments to CDC for weekly publication are provisional because of ongoing revision of information and delayed reporting. \r\n\r\nCase counts in this table are presented as they were published in the MMWR issues. Therefore, numbers listed in later MMWR weeks may reflect changes made to these counts as additional information becomes available.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\nC.N.M.I.: Commonwealth of Northern Mariana Islands.\r\nU: Unavailable. \u2014: No reported cases.

    "description": "Published in Volume 4, Issue 1, of Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, this paper provides an overview of results examining alternative Medicare post-acute care (PAC) episode definitions and exploring geographic differences in episode payments. The results of these analyses of PAC use vary based on 1) the denominator used to calculate an average payment level-all hospital discharges or solely PAC users 2) the mix and volume of PAC services, including decisions to include or exclude an acute hospital readmission and 3) the definition of the end point of an episode. The differences in PAC episode payments by geographic area show the geographic variation in the percent of beneficiaries discharged to PAC and the state variation in mean payment per PAC user. The results of these analyses provide information on the makeup of service use under different episode definitions and highlight considerations for providers and payers testing alternatives for bundled payment.\r\n",

Using data from 2007 to 2009, the study examined potentially avoidable hospitalizations rates by setting, state, and medical condition, and the average cost of these events. Beneficiaries in institutions were much more likely to have these events - 16 percent of beneficiaries in the study population were in an institution, yet comprised 45 percent of all potentially avoidable hospitalizations. The range in rates per 1,000 person years across the states was considerable from a low of 59 (Utah) to a high of 197 (Mississippi), a more than a threefold difference. Five conditions were responsible for nearly 80 percent of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. From 2007 to 2009, the national and state rates were fairly consistent.\r\n",

The Department works in partnership with these agencies: 12 not-for-profit corporations and one unit of local government, the City of Chicago.\r\n\r\nArea Agencies have the primary task of planning and coordinating services and programs for older people in their respective areas. The Area Agencies receive funding from the Department based on a formula which takes into consideration the number of older citizens and minorities in that area, as well as the number living in poverty, in rural areas, and alone. \r\n\r\nLike the Department on Aging, Area Agencies are not, as a rule, direct service providers. Area Agencies contract with local agencies which provide services to the older people who live in the same community.",

Although OCSE and state child support agencies collect and report a substantial amount of data about child support, they collect little about the economic and demographic characteristics of custodial families in the IV-D program. As a result, OCSE has worked with the U.S. Census Bureau since the 1970s to collect this type of data.  The Census Bureau adds a supplement every other year to its main household survey called the Current Population Survey (CPS). This supplement asks a series of questions that first identifies custodial families and then asks about child support awards and services received.",

Due largely to generic substitution, average prescription cost only grew by 4 percent during this period, although the average drug price rose by twice that amount. The analysis demonstrated that tiered copayments and other benefit management practices were effective at encouraging shifts to less costly drugs. The study also found that less competitive drug classes (defined as having limited availability of generics or limited therapeutic substitution) had larger price increases than more competitive classes (those with well established or emerging generic substitutes).\r\n",

Drugs marked 'unapproved medical gas', 'unapproved homeopathic' or 'unapproved drug other' on this Web site have not been evaluated by FDA for safety and efficacy and their labeling has not been approved.

This study, published in Volume 3, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, reports that, during the study period, only 3.7 percent of Medicaid enrollees moved to another state at least once, and the majority moved only once. Most moves (72.2 percent) were not associated with enrollment gaps, and 8.2 percent of moves were associated with gaps of fewer than three months. Enrollment gaps may indicate a lack of health insurance coverage, resulting in a lack of continuity of care and a risk to patient health outcomes, an increased use of higher cost emergency services, and higher system-wide health care costs. The studys findings provide a benchmark for adjusting national Medicaid statistics to reduce over-counting and improve the corresponding undercount in estimates of the uninsured population, thus, providing a context for further examining the consequences of enrollee moves on their health status and program expenditures.\r\n",

The authors analyses of Medicare claims data from 2009 and 2010 show that 54 percent of claims with a secondary diagnosis code of a pressure ulcer site did not have any pressure ulcer stage code (compared to only 10 percent of claims with a pressure ulcer as a primary diagnosis). On average, underreporting of stage codes occurred more often in hospitals classified as academic medical centers, larger, urban, or not-for-profit. The combination of capturing 25 diagnosis codes under the new 5010 claim format and the change from ICD-9 to ICD-10 will likely reduce some of the underreporting of the stages for hospital-acquired pressure ulcers.\r\n",

Patients with a ratio of less than 0.5 (meaning fewer controller and more rescue medication claims) were 1.5-2.0 times more likely to have a subsequent emergent healthcare visit than children with higher ratios. Providers and payers may consider tracking the asthma medication ratio and using it to signal pediatric patients at high risk for emergent health care visits. This will allow targeted interventions to improve controller medication use in these highest risk patients. Ultimately, increasing controller medication use in these patients would lead to improved ratios and fewer emergent healthcare visits.\r\n",

Roughly half of the 369 were mental health professionals, and about one-in-five of the 369 were non-physician professionals (e.g., physician assistants and nurse practitioners). The comparative advantage of mental health could be the verbal (rather than physical contact) nature of mental health care. The comparative advantage of non-physician professionals could be their lower labor costs. In some cases, it will be socially desirable to expand telehealth services, but only in cases where the value of emergency access or reduced patient travel time outweighs the additional cost of delivering care via telehealth.\r\n",

    "description": "Modeling Per Capita State Health Expenditure Variation State-Level Characteristics Matter, published in Volume 3, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, focuses on average spending in personal health care per capita at the state level for all payers. In contrast to this work, most of the prior research on geographic variation in health spending focused on health spending for Medicare enrollees, at a sub-state or individual level. This paper shows that state-level income, health care capacity, and the share of elderly residents are the most important factors in explaining variation in personal health care spending per capita among states over time. Because the slow-moving nature of health spending per capita and close relationships among state-level factors create inefficiencies in modeling this variation, multiple modeling strategies were utilized to obtain more robust interpretations of the overall results.\r\n",

The interviews reveal important policy findings. First, these changes in Medicaid built upon pre-existing state-funded health insurance programs for the poor,  second, cost and enrollment predictions were challenging, indicating the uncertainty in such projections for 2014, other lessons included a substantial need for behavioral health services in this population, and the administrative challenges of expanding coverage, and finally, the researchers learned how political context - support or opposition from stakeholders and the general public - plays a critical role in shaping the success of Medicaid expansions.",

    "title": "Wisconsins Experience with Medicaid Auto Enrollment", 
    "description": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) relies heavily on the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to cover uninsured populations. In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.",

While leaders described efforts to improve overall quality as driven by standardized metrics, this did not hold for efforts to reduce disparities. Data were frequently only examined by race and ethnicity when overall performance on a measure was low. Disparities were attributed to either individual choices or to cultural and linguistic factors, with plans focusing interventions on recently immigrated groups, despite trends in HEDIS measures that often did not support this focus.",

    "description": "Current Medicare payment policy for outpatient laboratory services is outdated. Future reforms, such as competitive bidding, should consider the characteristics of the laboratory market. To inform payment policy, we analyzed the structure of the national market for Medicare Part B clinical laboratory testing, using a 5 percent sample of 2006 Medicare claims data. The independent laboratory market is dominated by two firms, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. The hospital outreach market is not as concentrated as the independent laboratory market. Two subgroups of Medicare beneficiaries, those with end stage renal disease and those residing in nursing homes, are each served in separate laboratory markets. Despite the concentrated independent laboratory market structure, national competitive bidding for non patient laboratory tests could result in cost savings for Medicare.",

While relatively few adults in Idaho received a wellness exam after such coverage was added, the adoption of managed care for dental services was associated with increased receipt of dental care, including preventive care. New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions.",

Smaller ACOs are especially vulnerable to the chance of being inappropriately denied credit for achieved savings.

The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.",

This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program.

This burden is especially higher in rural areas, which are known to report higher cancer frequency and death rate. Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources. Non-participant states in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program can build similar powerful datasets to target cancer disparities.",

Disenrollees incurred 1,021 dollars per month in Medicare payments following disenrollment to FFS in 2007, which was 28 percent higher than predicted based on risk scores used to set MA payment rates. Differences between actual and predicted payments were smaller for disenrollees of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans than for Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), indicating less biased disenrollment from PPOs and PFFS plans. Analysis of 10 individual MA plans revealed considerable variation in the degree of biased disenrollment.

The study analyzed administrative data linked with cancer registry data to estimate cost of care for beneficiaries with cardiac disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The cost increases ranged from 4,385 dollars for cardiac disease to 11,009 dollars for mental health disorders.

The expert panel projects that 65 percent of primary care physicians in large group practices, 45 percent of primary care physicians in small group practices, and 44 percent of all other specialists could achieve the meaningful use of certified EHR technology by 2015. The expert panel also predicts that meaningful use rates could increase to 80 percent, 65 percent, and 66 percent in 2019 for these three groups, respectively. The information from this study is particularly valuable due to a high degree of uncertainty in a new policy environment and could help inform and evaluate CMS and ONC programs.",

Although encounter data provide insight, not all states report it to CMS Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS), and little is known about the datas usability. This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers.

Of CHCs with EHR systems, 30 percent had been in operation for less than one year, 31 percent for one to two years, and 39 percent for three or more years. Survey results were combined with 2009 Uniform Data System data to determine which factors impact use of Health IT and Meaningful Use readiness. Significant differences, by length of EHR operation were found for Medicaid patients, full or partial EHR adoption, and Patient Centered Medical Home recognition.

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control. This paper describes a method for standardizing claim payments, and demonstrates the difference in actual versus standardized payments by geographic region.",

CAP Grants provide nearly 30 million dollars in new resources to help States and territories establish or strengthen consumer assistance programs. CAP Grants were awarded in October 2010 and 38 States and Territories are using these resources to empower consumers and provide direct services to answer health \r\ninsurance questions. Data reported for the first year of the program (October 2010-October 2011) demonstrate the significant impact these programs have already made.",

In most States, insurance companies could refuse to sell them coverage, charge exorbitant premiums, or offer them coverage that excluded benefits for their health conditions. The result has been tens of thousands of Americans with serious health conditions like cancer and heart disease who have been unable to afford health insurance or to pay out of pocket for their own medical care.",

People living with conditions like diabetes, asthma, cancer, and HIV-AIDS have often been priced out of affordable health insurance options, and this has left millions without insurance.\r\n\r\nPCIP is a temporary program that covers a broad range of health benefits and is designed as a bridge for people with pre-existing conditions who cannot obtain health insurance coverage in todays private insurance market. As of May 31, 2011 24,712 Americans had insurance through PCIP and the coverage is making a difference. As of May 31, 2011 data from the federally run PCIP plan shows that of claims paid for the top 20 diagnoses, 30.2 percent were for diagnoses of heart disease and 25.8 percent were for diagnoses of cancer. A range of professional, inpatient and drug treatments were provided to these individuals.",

The Act ensures that, in any State, any proposed rate increase by individual or small group market insurers at or above 10 percent will be scrutinized by independent experts to make sure it is justified. This analysis will help moderate premium hikes and lower costs for individuals, families, and businesses that buy insurance in these markets. Additionally, insurance companies must provide easy to understand information to their customers about their reasons for unreasonable rate increases, as well as publicly justify and post on their website any unreasonable rate increases. These steps allow consumers to know why they are paying higher rates.",

The crowding-out of private insurance is often used to criticize state Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansion, as already insured children move their coverage to the states at the publics expense. A difficulty in discussing crowd-out comes from inconsistent estimates. Previous work focusing on the expansion of public programs has led to estimates ranging from 0 to 50 percent of the children newly insured on public plans being crowded-out.",

Brief descriptions for the code ranges and modifiers are provided in the readme file. The data set name contains the year followed by a five character sequence that is the HCPC CPT code. This HCPC CPT code corresponds to the first HCPC CPT in the selected code range of disciplines. Within each code range are, procedural, condition, or description subheadings. Each data set displays the allowed services, allowed charges, and payment amounts by HCPC CPT codes and prominent modifiers. These reports will only illustrate the modifiers where duplicative claim submissions occur. This is to avoid duplicate counting of services. Utilization for modifiers not affected by duplicative counting are collapsed into the Other category on the reports. Therefore, not all Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services published modifiers are illustrated. The file is updated annually and usually available by September for the previous year.",

The Minimum Data Set (MDS) is part of the federally mandated process for clinical assessment of all residents in Medicare or Medicaid certified nursing homes. This process provides a comprehensive assessment of each residents functional capabilities and helps nursing home staff identify health problems. Resident Assessment Protocols (RAPs), are part of this process, and provide the foundation upon which a residents individual care plan is formulated. MDS assessment forms are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes, regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on admission to the nursing facility and then periodically, within specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health care professionals employed by the nursing home. MDS information is transmitted electronically by nursing homes to the MDS database in their respective States. MDS information from the State databases is captured into the national MDS database at CMS. Data from the MDS for 1st quarter 2005 through 3rd quarter 2010 are reported. In future years, this measure will be changing to percentage of long-term nursing facility residents with major falls. The data source will then be MDS 3.0.",

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.",

    "description": "This report analyzes the use of dental services by children enrolled in Medicaid from federal fiscal years (FFY) 2000 to 2010. The number and percent of children receiving dental services under Medicaid climbed continuously over the decade. In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.\r\n\r\nIn that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent. In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.\r\n\r\nWhile most states have made steady progress in improving childrens access to dental care in Medicaid over the past decade, there is still substantial variation across states and more remains to be done.",

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.",

Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. Insurance Component Summary Tables \r\nThe Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected. \r\nMEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November. National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors. State and metro area tables: State-level estimates for the private sector by firm size, industry groupings, ownership type, age of firm, employee characteristics, and average wage quartiles.

    "description": "RadLex is a controlled terminology for radiology and serves as a single unified source of radiology terms for radiology practice, education, and research. RadLex is a comprehensive lexicon for standardized indexing and retrieval of radiology information resources. With more than 30,000 terms, RadLex satisfies the needs of software developers, system vendors and radiology users by adopting the best features of existing terminology systems while producing new terms to fill critical gaps. RadLex also provides a comprehensive and technology-friendly replacement for the ACR Index for Radiological Diagnoses. It unifies and supplements other lexicons and standards, such as SNOMED-CT, LOINC, and DICOM. As images, image reports, and medical records continue to move online RadLex meets the need of physicians to organize and retrieve image data using a common set of terms.\r\n\r\nRadReport is a radiology reporting initiative that is a part of RadLex. RadReport aims to improve reporting practices by creating a library of clear and consistent report templates.  Report templates and information about RadReport is available at the link in Resource 2.\r\n\r\n",

The HDW provides both raw data sets as well as an array of visual and interactive tools for searching, accessing, viewing and displaying a broad range of HRSA programmatic information, related health resources, geographic data and demographic data. The HDW promotes information sharing and collaboration among HRSA staff, HRSA partners, grantees, care providers, health planners and policy makers and other audiences interested in HRSA's public health services and information. The current version of the HDW includes data from the following HRSA Bureaus and Offices: BCRS, BHPR, BPHC, HAB, MCHB, OA, OPAE, ORHP and OSHA, with additional Bureau and Office data added and updated on an ongoing basis. The HDW provides quick access to information that includes: - Find A Health Center - with search-by-address capabilities, maps and driving directions; - Identify HRSA Grants by Key Program Area or State; - Locate Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) by address; - Identify HPSAs Eligible for Medicare Physician Bonus Payment; - Locate Medically Underserved Areas and Population (MUA/P) groups by address. In addition, the HDW provides the ability to explore data and maps that include: - Reports - traditional text-based reporting of the data is available in the HDW. Users can select, sort, export and view the data either by spreadsheet or preformatted reports; - Maps - visually explore the HRSA-specific information, health resources and demographic data in geographic relation to one another; - Map Data Services - utilize data from the HDW to create custom maps and incorporate your own data; and - Downloads - ability to download data on Health Professional Shortage Areas, Primary Care Service Areas, and National Sample Survey of Registered Nurses. The HDW data content and functionality are continually evolving so a What's New page is made available. The data is refreshed continually and most data are updated on a daily basis. Please see the Data Refresh Dates section of the website for more information. The HDW is designed to provide extensive tabular and spatial information available on HRSA-supported programs and related health resources. To do this, the warehouse combines data from various federal sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and various HRSA programs. For more information about where the data in the data warehouse comes from, see the Data Sources section of the website.",

NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can compare tools on NITRC and developers can seek and receive help from the community to make their tools more usable and accessible. ",

The standardized costs presented in the dashboard were not re-scaled to be equal to actual costs for the study population.  In 2011 actual per capita costs for the study population equaled $9,539 compared to standardized per capita costs of $9,003.  In general, total standardized per capita costs are less than actual per capita costs because we removed extra payments Medicare made to hospitals, such as payments for medical education (both direct and indirect) and payments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  Standardization does not adjust for differences in beneficiaries\u2019 health status. \r\n\r\nThe dashboard includes total standardized per capita spending, as well as standardized per capita spending by type of service.  The interactive format allows users to select the indicator and year they want to display.  Users can also compare data for a given state to the national average.  All of the information presented in the Dashboard is also available for download from the Geographic Variation Public Use File.",

We have aggregated this data into a Geographic Variation Public Use File that has demographic, spending, utilization, and quality indicators at the state level (including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), hospital referral region (HRR) level, and county level.\r\n\r\nThe Geographic Variation Public Use File has twelve separate files \u2013 two files with state and county-level data, four files with only state-level data, and six files with HRR-level data.  The files are presented in two different formats.  The \u201cTable\u201d files present indicators for all states, counties, or HRRs, and can easily be exported from Excel to another data analysis program for additional analysis, while the corresponding \u201cReport\u201d files allow users to compare a specific state, county, or HRR to national Medicare benchmarks.  The state- and HRR-level data is presented for beneficiaries under the age of 65, beneficiaries that are 65 or older, and all beneficiaries regardless of age.  However, the county-level data is only available for all beneficiaries.  Each file has a brief Methods section outlining the sample population and methodology that we used to calculate these indicators and a Documentation section which explains the individual indicators in more detail.  Finally, there is also a Methodological Overview paper and a Technical Supplement on Standardization that provides additional information on the methodology we used to standardize claim payment amounts.\r\n\r\nIn May 2013, CMS updated the Geographic Variation Public Use File data files that were originally posted in July 2011 and updated in July 2012 and January 2013.  The May 2013 update includes county-level data and reflects several minor revisions to the CMS methodology.  Those revisions are described in detail in the Methodological Overview paper.",

Based on the patient's responses, the tool generates a substance involvement score that suggests the level of intervention needed.

    "description": "The NIS is the largest publicly available all-payer inpatient care database in the United States. It contains data from approximately 8 million hospital stays each year.  It approximates a 20-percent stratified sample of U.S. community hospitals and allows for weighted national estimates to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe NIS is drawn from States participating in HCUP. NIS data are available since 1988, allowing analysis of trends over time. \r\n\r\nThe NIS includes charge information for all patients, regardless of payer, including persons covered by Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured. \r\n\r\nThe NIS's large sample size enables analyses of rare conditions, such as congenital anomalies; uncommon treatments, such as organ transplantation; and special patient populations, such as the uninsured. \r\nFor most States, the NIS includes hospital identifiers that permit linkages to the American Hospital Association (AHA) Annual Survey Database and county identifiers that permit linkages to the Area Resource File. \r\n\r\nThe NIS contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources). The NIS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals. \r\n",

    "description": "The Nanomaterial Registry compiles data from multiple databases into a single resource.  The goal of this resource is to establish a curated nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent information on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances. The publicly available Registry is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the nanomaterial community, providing data that has been systematically curated based on minimal information standards built with broad community acceptance. It provides a way to tie together different sources of information for a specific nanomaterial and allows users to search and compare characteristic data on different nanomaterials. \r\n\r\nThe registry provides tools for analyzing and comparing data on the biological and environmental implications of well-characterized nanomaterials. This resource will evolve as the quality and quantity of the information on nanomaterials improve. Hundreds of nanomaterial entries have been curated into the registry for physico-chemical characteristics and are available to the public. Biological and environmental study data for existing nanomaterial entries will also be curated into the registry.\r\n\r\nThe nanomaterial registry provides the following functions for the research community: basic and advance search through key words or physical and chemical characteristics (PCC); ability to browse nanomaterials based on categories; detailed information about PCC and the biological, and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; display the quality of the characterization of each nanomaterial entry in the form of compliance level that is algorithm based; compare PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; and find similar nanomaterials based on PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials.",

    "title": "1997 through 2010 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS)", 
    "description": "The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.\r\n\r\nData collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.\r\n\r\nThe data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).\r\n\r\nN-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.\r\n\r\nThe N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

    "description": "The Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D) is an administrative data system providing descriptive information about discharges from alcohol or drug treatment in facilities that report to individual state administrative data systems. TEDS-D is part of a reporting system that was originally designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. The TEDS -- Admissions (TEDS-A) component began in 1992, and the TEDS-D component began reporting data in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to and discharged from public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables. Variables unique to TEDS-D not included on the TEDS-A file include the person's length of stay in treatment and reason for discharge.\r\n\r\nTEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding.

Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.\r\n\r\nThe questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).\r\n\r\nSurvey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.\r\n\r\nThe NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nDAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.",

The NEDS can be weighted to produce national estimates.\r\n\r\nThe NEDS is the largest all-payer ED database in the United States.  It was constructed using records from both the HCUP State Emergency Department Databases (SEDD) and the State Inpatient Databases (SID), both also described in healthdata.gov. The SEDD capture information on ED visits that do not result in an admission (i.e., treat-and-release visits and transfers to another hospital). The SID contain information on patients initially seen in the emergency room and then admitted to the same hospital. \r\n\r\nThe NEDS contains 25-30 million (unweighted) records for ED visits for over 950 hospitals and approximates a 20-percent stratified sample of U.S. hospital-based EDs. \r\n\r\nThe NEDS contains information about geographic characteristics, hospital characteristics, patient characteristics, and the nature of visits (e.g., common reasons for ED visits, including injuries).   The NEDS contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources). It includes ED charge information for over 75% of patients, regardless of payer, including patients covered by Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured. The NEDS excludes data elements that could directly or indirectly identify individuals, hospitals, or states.\r\n",

Researchers and policymakers can use the KID to identify, track, and analyze national trends in health care utilization, access, charges, quality, and outcomes. \r\n\r\nThe KID is the only hospital administrative dataset designed specifically to assess use of hospital services by newborns, children, and adolescents. The KID enables studies of specific conditions, procedures, and subpopulations that often cannot be assessed with other databases because children account for a relatively small proportion of hospital stays. \r\n\r\nUsing the KID, it is possible to study varied topics including the incidence of uncommon conditions such as congenital anomalies, the economic burden associated with specific procedures or conditions such as adolescent pregnancy, and the pediatric conditions most often associated with particular outcomes such as death in the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe KID is the only all-payer inpatient care database for children in the United States.  It is a sample of pediatric discharges from 2,500-4,000 U.S. hospitals yielding approximately two to three million unweighted hospital discharges for children per year.  About 10 percent of normal newborns and 80 percent of other neonatal and pediatric stays are selected from each hospital that is sampled.  \r\n\r\nThe KID contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  It includes charge information on all patients, regardless of payer, including children covered by Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured.

OTIS reports case counts, incidence rates, population counts, percentage of cases that completed therapy within 1 year of diagnosis, and percentage of cases tested for drug susceptibility. Data for 22 variables are included in the data set, including: age groups, race / ethnicity, sex, vital status, year reported, state, metropolitan area, several patient risk factors, directly observed therapy, disease verification criteria and multi-drug resistant TB. Each year these data are updated with an additional year of cases plus revisions to cases reported in previous years.

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

    "description": "The Daily Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are geographically aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor air, spanning the years 2003-2008. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

The MAX files are constructed from claims and eligibility data that states submit to CMS electronically through the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS).  One set of products is the Statistical Compendium:  Medicaid Pharmacy Benefit Use and Reimbursement (hereafter \"the Compendium\") for calendar years 1999 and 2001-2007.  The Compendium for each year provides detailed state-by-state and national data on the use of and reimbursement for prescription drugs in Medicaid.  (A Compendium was not produced for calendar year 2000.)  Using the detailed data from the Compendium, MPR has also prepared Chartbooks for 1999 and 2001-2007.  The Chartbooks present selected highlights from the Compendium and include comparisons across states.  The 2001-2007 Chartbooks also include comparisons to earlier years.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.",

Congress and OMB now use performance information to support budget decisions. Many state and local governments are requiring similar systems of accountability to document results and justify funding.In order to gather information on the performance of its program, the Administration on Aging surveys the participants in its Older Americans Act programs. These national surveys provide a portrait of who receives these services and how they assess the quality of the services received.",

Each HCPCS code on the carrier bill must be accompanied by a line item ICD-9 diagnosis code, providing a reason for the service. In addition, each line item has the fields for the dates of service, reimbursement amount, provider numbers (e.g., NPI), and beneficiary demographic data.

    "description": "The Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) is a computerized information database designed to support the FDA's post-marketing safety surveillance program for all approved drug and therapeutic biologic products. The FDA uses AERS to monitor for new adverse events and medication errors that might occur with these marketed products. Reporting of adverse events from the point of care is voluntary in the United States. FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools. A simple search of AERS data cannot be performed with these files by persons who are not familiar with creation of relational databases.",

Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999.

    "title": "QuitNowTXT Text Messaging Library", 
    "description": "Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''\u00a2 Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''\u00a2 Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''\u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''\u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.",

Warning Letters are issued to achieve voluntary compliance and to establish prior notice.  The use of Warning Letters and the prior notice policy are based on the expectation that most individuals and firms will voluntarily comply with the law.

    "description": "This is a Public Use File of Inpatient Claims drawn from the 2008 Beneficiary Summary File of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled during the calendar year 2008, and their associated Medicare claims.  The most important aspects of this file are as follow: 1. It contains claims for a simple random sample of 5% of the 2008 beneficiary population. Out of approximately 2.4 million beneficiaries in the 5% sample, about 350,000 had claims (after excluding a relatively small fraction of ineligible claims), resulting in a Public Use File of just under 590,000 claims. 2. It contains six (6) analytic variables (in addition to an encrypted claim key): Age, gender, base DRG code, ICD-9 code, claim cost, and length of inpatient stay. All of these variables, except gender, have been suitably aggregated or averaged in order to protect individuals from identification, while retaining the analytic value of the data. 3. A claim for a sampled beneficiary is only included in the PUF if the combination of all six (6) variables is shared by at least eleven (11) claims pertaining to at least eleven (11) distinct beneficiaries in the population (but not necessarily the sample). 4. Claims cannot be linked by beneficiary, and cannot be linked to any external data source by means of the claim ID. The claim ID is a cryptographic key specific to this Inpatient Claims PUF and not available elsewhere. The inpatient Claims PUF is sorted by this claim ID to ensure that the relative position of claims in the PUF and the original source data are totally uncorrelated.",

The CHSI report and dataset was designed not only for public health professionals but also for members of the community who are interested in the health of their community. The CHSI report contains over 200 measures for each of the 3,141 United States counties.
