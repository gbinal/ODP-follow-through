The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the yield on a nominal coupon bond that pays semiannual interest.",

    "description": "Treasury Long-Term Average Rate and Extrapolation Factors. Beginning February 18, 2002, Treasury ceased publication of the 30-year constant maturity series. Instead, from February 19, 2002 through May 28, 2004, Treasury published a Long-Term Average Rate, \"LT>25,\" (not to be confused with the Long-Term Composite Rate, definitions below). In addition, Treasury published daily linear extrapolation factors that could be added to the Long-Term Average Rate to allow interested parties to compute an estimated 30-year rate. On June 1, 2004, Treasury discontinued the \"LT>25\" average due to a dearth of eligible bonds. In place of the \"LT>25\" average, Treasury published the Treasury 20-year Constant Maturity rate on this page along with an extrapolation factor that was added to the 20-year Constant Maturity to obtain an estimate for a theoretical 30-year rate. On February 9, 2006, Treasury reintroduced the 30-year constant maturity and is no longer publishing the extrapolation factor.",

Market quotations are obtained at approximately 3:30 PM each business day by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Bank Discount rate is the rate at which a Bill is quoted in the secondary market and is based on the par value, amount of the discount and a 360-day year. The Coupon Equivalent, also called the Bond Equivalent, or the Investment Yield, is the bill's yield based on the purchase price, discount, and a 365- or 366-day year. The Coupon Equivalent can be used to compare the yield on a discount bill to the yield on a nominal coupon bond that pays semiannual interest.",
