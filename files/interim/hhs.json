A health tracking indicator is a metric through which progress on a certain area of health improvement can be assessed.  The indicators are organized by the Priority Area of the Prevention Agenda as well as the Focus Area under each Priority Area.  This dataset includes tracking indicators for the five Priority Areas of the Prevention Agenda 2013-2017.  Along with the name of each indicator are given the baseline year, the baseline year county value of the indicator, and the Prevention Agenda 2017 state target for the indicator. Sub-indicators are included in this dataset to measure health disparities among socioeconomic groups.For more information check out: http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/prevention_agenda/2013-2017/ or go to the \u201cabout\u201d tab.",

Medicare payments include both geographic and policy-based facility type differentials (e.g., wage index and disproportionate share hospital), which can bias cost comparisons of hospitals and averages across geographic areas. Standardizing payment information to remove the area- and policy-based payment differentials should normalize much of the observed geographic variability in payments, allowing for a more accurate comparison of resource use between providers and across geographic regions. Use of standardized payments will ensure that observed payment variation is due to differences in practice patterns and service use, rather than Medicare payment differences over which the providers have no control. This paper describes a method for standardizing claim payments, and demonstrates the difference in actual versus standardized payments by geographic region.",

    "description": "This dataset measures the air, water, milk, fish, sediment, fruit/veg, and vegetation at Nine Mile Point and James A Fitzpatrick and other locations(background) around NYS to determine the normal levels of radioactivity and monitors the influence of human activities on these levels. The site numbers represent the location from which samples are collected. This dataset is not designed, or intended to monitor releases from discharge points at a specific facility (e.g., a stack). The facility operator performs this type of monitoring to meet the requirements of its licensing agency (e.g., a federal agency or the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation). A column has been added for values which can be graphed. Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0. Variations in detection limit are due to variations in sample collection and measurement instrument performance.

    "title": "Wisconsins Experience with Medicaid Auto Enrollment",
    "description": "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) relies heavily on the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to cover uninsured populations. In February 2008, Wisconsin expanded and reformed its Medicaid CHIP program and, as part of program implementation, automatically enrolled a set of newly eligible parents and children. This process of auto enrollment targeted newly eligible parents and older children whose children siblings were already enrolled in the states Medicaid CHIP program. Auto enrollment brought over 44,000 individuals into the program, representing more than 60 percent of all enrollees in the first month of the reformed program. Individuals who were auto enrolled were modestly more likely to leave the program relative to other individuals who enrolled in February 2008, unless their incomes were high enough to be required to pay premiums. These auto enrollees were much more likely to exit relative to other enrollees subject to premium payments. The higher exit rates exhibited by non premium paying auto enrollees were likely due to the fact that over 40 percent of auto enrollees were covered by a private insurance policy in the month of their enrollment, compared to approximately 30 percent for regular enrollees. A national simulation of an auto enrollment process similar to Wisconsins, including the expansion of adult Medicaid eligibility to 133 percent of the federal poverty level under the ACA, suggests that 2.5 million of the 5.6 million newly eligible parents could be auto enrolled, and approximately 25 percent of this population would be privately insured. These results suggest that auto enrollment may be appropriate for other states, especially in their efforts to enroll eligible populations who are not subject to premium requirements.",

While leaders described efforts to improve overall quality as driven by standardized metrics, this did not hold for efforts to reduce disparities. Data were frequently only examined by race and ethnicity when overall performance on a measure was low. Disparities were attributed to either individual choices or to cultural and linguistic factors, with plans focusing interventions on recently immigrated groups, despite trends in HEDIS measures that often did not support this focus.",

The independent laboratory market is dominated by two firms, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America. The hospital outreach market is not as concentrated as the independent laboratory market. Two subgroups of Medicare beneficiaries, those with end stage renal disease and those residing in nursing homes, are each served in separate laboratory markets. Despite the concentrated independent laboratory market structure, national competitive bidding for non patient laboratory tests could result in cost savings for Medicare.",

    "description": "According to findings reported in The Effects of Medicaid Policy Changes on Adults Service Use Patterns in Kentucky and Idaho, published in Volume 2, Issue 4, of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, Idaho and Kentucky became two of the first states to implement benefit and cost sharing changes to their Medicaid programs under authority granted by the 2005 Deficit Reduction Act. While relatively few adults in Idaho received a wellness exam after such coverage was added, the adoption of managed care for dental services was associated with increased receipt of dental care, including preventive care. New limits on brand name prescriptions in Kentucky were associated with a reduction in the proportion of enrollees with two or more monthly name brand prescriptions, but small copayments introduced did not appear to have a dramatic impact. Thus, changes in financial incentives on both the supply side (such as reimbursement increases) and the demand side (i.e., benefit changes) alone may not be enough to generate the desired levels of preventive care, especially among those with chronic health conditions.",

Although CMS is fairly well protected from the chance that an Accountable Care Organization (ACO) would be rewarded inappropriately for savings that did not truly occur, ACOs are much less protected from the analogous chance that they are inappropriately denied rewards for savings that do occur. Smaller ACOs are especially vulnerable to the chance of being inappropriately denied credit for achieved savings. The article concludes with a discussion of strategies that can be used to anticipate and minimize the role of chance variation in ACO savings measurement.\r\n",

The crowding-out of private insurance is often used to criticize state Medicaid and Childrens Health Insurance Program (CHIP) expansion, as already insured children move their coverage to the states at the publics expense. A difficulty in discussing crowd-out comes from inconsistent estimates. Previous work focusing on the expansion of public programs has led to estimates ranging from 0 to 50 percent of the children newly insured on public plans being crowded-out.",

    "description": "Reconciling Medical Expenditure Estimates from the MEPS and NHEA, 2007, published in Volume 2, Issue 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, provides a comparison of health care expenditure estimates for 2007 from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and the National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA). The study focuses on the personal health care (PHC) sector, which includes the goods and services rendered to treat or prevent a specific disease or condition in an individual. The official 2007 NHEA estimate for PHC spending is 1,915 billion dollars and the MEPS estimate is 1,126 billion dollars. Adjusting the NHEA estimates for differences in underlying populations, covered services, and other measurement concepts reduces the NHEA estimate for 2007 to 1,366 billion dollars. As a result, MEPS is 240 billion dollars, or 17.6 percent less than the adjusted NHEA total. The reconciliation provides a consistent baseline of health expenditure data for policy simulations, enabling researchers to adjust MEPS to be consistent with the NHEA so that the projected costs, as well as budgetary and tax implications of any policy change are consistent with national health spending estimates.",

A 10-percent increase in reporting, the equivalent to reporting one more indicator per agency, increased the probability of a home health agency leaving an area with less-educated people by 0.3 percentage points, compared with leaving an area with high education. This small level of market-area exits under public reporting is unlikely to be practically meaningful, suggesting that Home Health Compare did not lead to a disruption in access to home health care through selective exits during the initial year of the program. Read the full paper, Public Reporting and Market Area Exit Decisions by Home Health Agencies published in Volume 2, Issue 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review.",

MDS assessment forms are completed for all residents in certified nursing homes, regardless of source of payment for the individual resident. MDS assessments are required for residents on admission to the nursing facility and then periodically, within specific guidelines and time frames. In most cases, participants in the assessment process are licensed health care professionals employed by the nursing home.

Rates increased by more than 1 percent in only 30 HRRs, with the largest increase in Bloomington, Illinois. Readmission rates at hospitals participating in the P4P program have been, on average, consistently lower than the rates at non-participating hospitals within all size categories except for the very smallest and largest hospitals, but rates at both participant and non-participant hospitals fell in 2012.",

Even though there is a lack of standard definition and identification of a chronic condition, these conditions, such as heart disease, cancer, obesity, and diabetes, are long-lasting and persistent health problems that require continuous care. Recent research has emphasized the disproportionate share of beneficiaries with chronic conditions in healthcare expenditures (Anderson, 2010). For example, patients with multiple chronic conditions can cost up to seven times as much as patients with only one chronic condition. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases are responsible for more than 75 percent of the 2.5 trillion spent annually on health care. Examples of efforts to estimate the spending or costs by individual conditions are shown in Exhibit 1.",

Population based cancer research, aimed at identifying variations in cancer care and improving cancer outcomes in the rural and medically underserved elderly population, is much needed. Unfortunately, such research has been challenging due to limitations in available data sources. The research article, entitled Linking Medicare, Medicaid, and Cancer Registry Data to Study the Burden of Cancers in West Virginia, published in Volume 2, Number 4 of the Medicare and Medicaid Research Review, describes the creation of a comprehensive dataset by combining the West Virginia Cancer Registry with Medicare, Medicaid, and other data sources. Non-participant states in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program can build similar powerful datasets to target cancer disparities.",

    "description": "This report analyzes the use of dental services by children enrolled in Medicaid from federal fiscal years (FFY) 2000 to 2010. The number and percent of children receiving dental services under Medicaid climbed continuously over the decade. In FFY 2000, 6.3 million children ages 1 to 20 were reported to receive some form of dental care (either preventive or treatment) the number more than doubled to 15.4 million by FFY 2010. Part of the increase was because the overall number of children covered by Medicaid rose by 12 million (50 percent), but the percentage of children who received dental care climbed appreciably from 29.3. percent in FFY 2000 to 46.4 percent in FFY 2010.\r\n\r\nIn that same time period, the number of children ages 1 to 20 receiving preventive dental services climbed from a reported 5.0 million to 13.6 million, while the percentage of children receiving preventive dental services rose from 23.2 to 40.8 percent. For children ages 1 to 20 who received dental treatment services, the reported number rose from 3.3 million in FFY 2000 to 7.6 million in FFY 2010. The percentage of children who obtained dental treatment services increased from 15.3 to 22.9 percent. In FFY 2010, about one sixth of children covered by Medicaid (15.7 percent) ages 6-14 had a dental sealant placed on a permanent molar.\r\n\r\nWhile most states have made steady progress in improving childrens access to dental care in Medicaid over the past decade, there is still substantial variation across states and more remains to be done.",

Disenrollees incurred 1,021 dollars per month in Medicare payments following disenrollment to FFS in 2007, which was 28 percent higher than predicted based on risk scores used to set MA payment rates. Differences between actual and predicted payments were smaller for disenrollees of Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans than for Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs), indicating less biased disenrollment from PPOs and PFFS plans. Analysis of 10 individual MA plans revealed considerable variation in the degree of biased disenrollment. These findings raise concerns about care experiences among sicker enrollees and increased costs to Medicare.",

The study analyzed administrative data linked with cancer registry data to estimate cost of care for beneficiaries with cardiac disease, respiratory diseases, diabetes, and mental health disorders. The cost increases ranged from 4,385 dollars for cardiac disease to 11,009 dollars for mental health disorders. Medicaid cancer patients often have preexisting chronic conditions and these conditions are projected to increase in the future. The implementation of better care management processes for cancer patients with preexisting chronic conditions may be one way to reduce these costs.\r\n",

The expert panel projects that 65 percent of primary care physicians in large group practices, 45 percent of primary care physicians in small group practices, and 44 percent of all other specialists could achieve the meaningful use of certified EHR technology by 2015. The expert panel also predicts that meaningful use rates could increase to 80 percent, 65 percent, and 66 percent in 2019 for these three groups, respectively.

This issue brief summarizes the availability, completeness, quality, and usability of the encounter data in the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) File, derived from MSIS, for enrollees in comprehensive managed care plans. It also gives specific information by state. The results should be encouraging for researchers and policymakers. Most states that have comprehensive managed care plans reported data to the other services (OT), inpatient (IP), and prescription drug (RX) files in 2008. Of those data, the majority are usable.",

Readings where a less than value is displayed show a value that is less than the detection limit of the measurement method and are essentially equivalent to 0.

The dataset includes separate estimates of the percent of students overweight, obese and overweight or obese for all reportable grades within the county and/or region and by grade groups (elementary and middle/high).   The rates of overweight and obesity reported are percentages based on counts of students in selected grades (Pre-K, K, 2, 4, 7, 10) reported to the NYSDOH. Because these rates reflect a broad range of factors that vary by school district, to make comparisons about observed differences in the rates of obesity and overweight between school districts requires the use of multivariate statistics.

    "description": "As a way of monitoring managed care plan performance and improving the quality of care provided to New York State residents, the New York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) collects data for four types of managed care insurance (commercial HMO, commercial Preferred Provider Organization, Medicaid managed care, and Child Health Plus) on an annual basis. Not all measures are collected each year. Some services require more resource intensive methods of collection, and these measures are collected every other year to reduce the burden associated with reviewing patient records. Refer to the Health Measures Descriptions document to learn about the specific measures included in this dataset. Measure specification changes and health plan mergers and closures preclude the ability to trend this data over time. Please use caution when attempting to compare measures and/or health plans over time. For more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/health_care/managed_care/reports/quality_performance_improvement.htm, or go to the \"About\" tab.",

Therefore the percentage of the student population represented in the county-level estimates varies from county to county.  This limits researchers' ability to draw absolute conclusions about observed differences in student weight status among counties.\r\n\r\nFor more information check out http://www.health.ny.gov/prevention/obesity/.",

BRFSS monitors modifiable risk behaviors and other factors contributing to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the population. New York State's BRFSS sample represents the non-institutionalized adult household population, aged 18 years and older.\r\n\r\nAlthough the overall number of respondents in the BRFSS is more than sufficiently large for statistical inference purposes, subgroup analyses can lead to estimates that are unreliable. Interpreting and reporting weighted numbers that are based on a small, unweighted number of respondents can mislead the reader into believing that a given finding is much more precise than it actually is. The BRFSS follows a rule of not reporting or interpreting percentages based upon a denominator of fewer than 50 respondents (unweighted sample). Both a csv and sas data files are available.\r\n\r\nFor more information, check out http://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/brfss/.",

During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents' health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service. HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level).  Public Use Files are available.",

Some of these tables can be customized online. State-level estimates of household medical utilization and expenditures are also provided for selected states. Insurance Component Summary Tables \r\nThe Insurance Component summary tables provide estimates at the national, state, and metro area levels on employer-based health insurance: number and types of insurance plans, premiums, benefits, contributions by employers and employees, and employer characteristics. Please note, in preparation for improvements in the data collection process, 2007 data for the Insurance Component was not collected. \r\nMEPS employer-based health insurance tables are produced in the year following data collection. Private-sector tables are posted in July; government and civilian tables are posted in November. National-level tables: Private sector estimates by firm size, industry group, census regions and other characteristics; public sector data by state and local government types, government size, and census division; civilian estimates that incorporate both the private and state and local government sectors; national totals for enrollees and cost of health insurance coverage for both the private and public sectors. State and metro area tables: State-level estimates for the private sector by firm size, industry groupings, ownership type, age of firm, employee characteristics, and average wage quartiles. Metropolitan area private sector estimates of premiums, employee contributions, enrollments, and take-up rates by firm size. \r\n",

NITRC collects and points to standardized information about tools, making the task of finding and comparing them easier than before. The site can help researchers find the right functional or structural neuroimaging tool or resource for their research. NITRC has recently added services such as cloud-based computing and data storage, and is broadening the range of scientific domains from MR to PET, SPECT, CT, MEG/EEG and optical imaging. Additional domains of interest are digital atlasing, and computational neuroscience, including large-scale and multi-scale modeling. The NITRC team searches out relevant research tools and resources to house on the site. Researchers can compare tools on NITRC and developers can seek and receive help from the community to make their tools more usable and accessible. ",

The standardized costs presented in the dashboard were not re-scaled to be equal to actual costs for the study population.  In 2011 actual per capita costs for the study population equaled $9,539 compared to standardized per capita costs of $9,003.  In general, total standardized per capita costs are less than actual per capita costs because we removed extra payments Medicare made to hospitals, such as payments for medical education (both direct and indirect) and payments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.  Standardization does not adjust for differences in beneficiaries\u2019 health status. \r\n\r\nThe dashboard includes total standardized per capita spending, as well as standardized per capita spending by type of service.  The interactive format allows users to select the indicator and year they want to display.  Users can also compare data for a given state to the national average.  All of the information presented in the Dashboard is also available for download from the Geographic Variation Public Use File.",

    "description": "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has developed data that enables researchers and policymakers to evaluate geographic variation in the utilization and quality of health care services for the Medicare fee-for-service population.  We have aggregated this data into a Geographic Variation Public Use File that has demographic, spending, utilization, and quality indicators at the state level (including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands), hospital referral region (HRR) level, and county level.\r\n\r\nThe Geographic Variation Public Use File has twelve separate files \u2013 two files with state and county-level data, four files with only state-level data, and six files with HRR-level data.  The files are presented in two different formats.  The \u201cTable\u201d files present indicators for all states, counties, or HRRs, and can easily be exported from Excel to another data analysis program for additional analysis, while the corresponding \u201cReport\u201d files allow users to compare a specific state, county, or HRR to national Medicare benchmarks.  The state- and HRR-level data is presented for beneficiaries under the age of 65, beneficiaries that are 65 or older, and all beneficiaries regardless of age.  However, the county-level data is only available for all beneficiaries.  Each file has a brief Methods section outlining the sample population and methodology that we used to calculate these indicators and a Documentation section which explains the individual indicators in more detail.  Finally, there is also a Methodological Overview paper and a Technical Supplement on Standardization that provides additional information on the methodology we used to standardize claim payment amounts.\r\n\r\nIn May 2013, CMS updated the Geographic Variation Public Use File data files that were originally posted in July 2011 and updated in July 2012 and January 2013.  The May 2013 update includes county-level data and reflects several minor revisions to the CMS methodology.  Those revisions are described in detail in the Methodological Overview paper.",

The goal of this resource is to establish a curated nanomaterial registry, whose primary function is to provide consistent information on the biological and environmental interactions of well-characterized nanomaterials, as well as links to associated publications, modeling tools, computational results and manufacturing guidances. The publicly available Registry is intended to serve as a comprehensive resource for the nanomaterial community, providing data that has been systematically curated based on minimal information standards built with broad community acceptance. It provides a way to tie together different sources of information for a specific nanomaterial and allows users to search and compare characteristic data on different nanomaterials. \r\n\r\nThe registry provides tools for analyzing and comparing data on the biological and environmental implications of well-characterized nanomaterials. This resource will evolve as the quality and quantity of the information on nanomaterials improve. Hundreds of nanomaterial entries have been curated into the registry for physico-chemical characteristics and are available to the public. Biological and environmental study data for existing nanomaterial entries will also be curated into the registry.\r\n\r\nThe nanomaterial registry provides the following functions for the research community: basic and advance search through key words or physical and chemical characteristics (PCC); ability to browse nanomaterials based on categories; detailed information about PCC and the biological, and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; display the quality of the characterization of each nanomaterial entry in the form of compliance level that is algorithm based; compare PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials; and find similar nanomaterials based on PCC and the biological and environmental interactions of nanomaterials.",

    "description": "The National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS) (formerly titled Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS)) is designed to collect information from all facilities in the United States, both public and private, that provides substance abuse treatment. N-SSATS is one of three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)) and is designed to provide the mechanism for quantifying the dynamic character and composition ofthe United States substance abuse treatment delivery system. In 1995, SAMHSA created BHSIS (formerly DASIS) to facilitate the integration of its existing treatment service's datasets and to reduce redundancy in data collection and reporting. The other two BHSIS components are the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The I-SATS is a comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities in the United States. The TEDS is a client-level database of individuals admitted to publicly funded substance abuse treatment facilities and is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, these three BHSIS components provide national- and state-level data on persons receiving alcohol and substance abuse treatment as well as data on the facilities providing the treatment.\r\n\r\nData collected in N-SSATS include topics covering ownership, services offered (assessment and pre-treatment, testing, transitional, ancillary, pharmacotherapies), primary focus (substance abuse, mental health, both, general health, other), hotline operation, methadone/Levo-Alpha Acetyl Methadol (LAAM)/buprenorphine dispensing, counseling and therapeutic approaches, special programs or groups, languages in which treatment is provided, type of treatment provided, number of clients (total and under age 18), number of beds, types of payment accepted, sliding fee scale, and facility accreditation and licensure/certification.\r\n\r\nThe data elements and format that make up the core of the N-SSATS were first used in 1976 as part of survey efforts designed to measure the scope and use of drug abuse treatment services in the United States. This core was used throughout the 1970s and 1980s in several different surveys. In 1987 the first administration of the National Drug and Alcoholism Treatment Unit Survey (NDATUS) took place, and then occurred annually from 1989 to 1993. After the creation of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in 1992, NDATUS was redesigned as the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS), which was conducted from 1995 to 1998. In 1999, an abbreviated survey was conducted and the survey was redesigned. The 1999 study is not publicly available. In 2000, the full survey was conducted and renamed the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS).\r\n\r\nN-SSATS is a point-prevalence survey. It provides information on the substance abuse treatment system and its clients on the reference date. Client counts reported here do not represent annual totals. Rather, N-SSATS provides a \"snapshot\" of substance abuse treatment facilities and clients on an average day. Through 2000, the N-SSATS reference date was October 1. In 2001, SAMHSA changed the reference date to the last business day in March. This change helped increase the timeliness of responses by individual facilities, but resulted in no data being collected for 2001. Therefore, 2002 marked the first year data were collected using the new reference date.\r\n\r\nThe N-SSATS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

    "description": "The Treatment Episode Data Set -- Discharges (TEDS-D) is an administrative data system providing descriptive information about discharges from alcohol or drug treatment in facilities that report to individual state administrative data systems. TEDS-D is part of a reporting system that was originally designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. The TEDS -- Admissions (TEDS-A) component began in 1992, and the TEDS-D component began reporting data in 2000.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS is a continuation of the former Client Data System (CDS) that was originally developed by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Administration (predecessor to SAMHSA) in consultation with representatives of the state substance abuse agencies and appropriate national organizations. TEDS is one of the three components of SAMHSA's Behavioral Health Services Information System (BHSIS, formerly Drug and Alcohol Services Information System (DASIS)). The core of BHSIS is the Inventory of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (I-SATS), formerly known as the National Master Facility Inventory (NMFI). The I-SATS is a continuously-updated comprehensive listing of all known substance abuse treatment facilities. The third component of BHSIS is the National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), formerly called the Uniform Facility Data Set (UFDS) survey. The N-SSATS is an annual survey of the location, characteristics, and utilization of alcoholism and drug abuse treatment facilities. The N-SSATS/UFDS is available from the SAMHDA Web site. Together, they provide national- and state-level information on the numbers and characteristics of individuals admitted to alcohol and drug treatment and describe the facilities that deliver care to those individuals. TEDS includes facilities that are licensed or certified by the state substance abuse agency to provide substance abuse treatment (or are administratively tracked for other reasons), and that are required by the states to provide TEDS client-level data.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to and discharged from public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding. TEDS includes both Minimum Data Set (MDS) data (required reporting) and Supplemental Data Set (SuDS) data (optional reporting), as reported to state substance abuse agencies by the treatment programs. Additional variables, such as calculated age and census region, are added to the state data. TEDS provides information on service setting, number of prior treatments, primary source of referral, employment status, whether methadone was prescribed in treatment, presence of psychiatric problems, living arrangements, health insurance, substance(s) abused, route of administration, age at first use, pregnancy and veteran status, number of days waiting to enter treatment, and demographic variables. Variables unique to TEDS-D not included on the TEDS-A file include the person's length of stay in treatment and reason for discharge.\r\n\r\nTEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.

While compromising a significant proportion of all admissions to substance abuse treatment, TEDS does not include all such admissions. The scope of admissions included in TEDS is affected by differences in state reporting practices, varying definitions of treatment admission, availability of public funds, and public funding constraints. In 1997, TEDS was estimated to include 83 percent of TEDS-eligible admissions and 67 percent of all known admissions. See the full documentation for additional information.\r\n\r\nThe TEDS series was designed to provide annual data on the number and characteristics of persons admitted to public and private substance abuse treatment programs receiving public funding.

Within each state, treatment providers that receive any state agency funding, including the federal Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment (SAPT) Block Grant monies, are expected to provide TEDS data for all clients admitted to treatment, regardless of the source of funding for individual clients.\r\n\r\nTEDS is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

NREPP is one way that SAMHSA is working to improve access to information on tested interventions and thereby reduce the lag time between the creation of scientific knowledge and its practical application in the field. \r\n\r\nNREPP is a voluntary, self-nominating system in which intervention developers elect to participate. There will always be some interventions that are not submitted to NREPP, and not all that are submitted are reviewed. In addition, new intervention summaries are continually being added, so the registry is always growing. Please check back regularly to access the latest updates. ",

    "title": "1990 through 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH)",
    "description": "The National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) series (formerly titled National Household Survey on Drug Abuse) is the general civilian population aged 12 and older in the United States. Questions include age at first use, as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drugs: alcohol, marijuana, cocaine (including crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, tobacco, pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, perceptions of risks, and needle-sharing. Demographic data include gender, race, age, ethnicity, educational level, job status, income level, veteran status, household composition, and population density.\r\n\r\nThe questionnaire was significantly redesigned in 1994. The 1994 survey for the first time included a rural population supplement to allow separate estimates to be calculated for this population. Other modules have been added each year and retained in subsequent years: mental health and access to care (1994-B); risk/availability of drugs (1996); cigar smoking and new questions on marijuana and cocaine use (1997); question series asked only of respondents aged 12 to 17 (1997); questions on tobacco brand (1999); marijuana purchase questions (2001); prior marijuana and cigarette use, additional questions on drug treatment, adult mental health services, and social environment (2003); and adult and adolescent depression questions derived from the National Comorbidity Survey, Replication (NCS-R) and National Comorbidity Survey, Adolescent (NCS-A) (2004).\r\n\r\nSurvey administration and sample design were improved with the implementation of the 1999 survey, and additional improvements were made in 2002. Since 1999, the survey sample has employed a 50-state design with an independent, multistage area probability sample for each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. At this time, the collection mode of the survey changed from personal interviews and self-enumerated answer sheets to using computer-assisted personal interviews and audio computer-assisted self interviews. In 2002, the survey's title was officially changed to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Participants have been given $30 for participating in the study since then. This has resulted in an increase in participation rates from the years prior to 2002. Also, since 2002 the new population data from the 2000 decennial census has been used for sample weighting procedures. For these reasons, data gathered for 2002 and beyond cannot validly be compared to data prior to 2002.\r\n\r\nThe NSDUH is sponsored by the Center for Behavioral Health Statistics and Quality, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.",

    "description": "The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) is a nationally representative public health surveillance system that continuously monitors drug-related visits to hospital emergency departments (EDs). A DAWN case is any ED visit involving recent drug use that is implicated in the ED visit. DAWN captures both ED visits that are directly caused by drugs and those in which drugs are a contributing factor but not the direct cause of the ED visit. Annually, DAWN produces estimates of drug-related visits to hospital EDs for the nation as a whole and for selected metropolitan areas.\r\n\r\nDAWN is used to monitor trends in drug misuse and abuse, identify the emergence of new substances and drug combinations, assess health hazards associated with drug abuse, and estimate the impact of drug misuse and abuse on the Nation's health care system. DAWN relies on a longitudinal probability sample of hospitals located throughout the United States. To be eligible for selection into the DAWN sample, a hospital must be a non-federal, short-stay, general surgical and medical hospital located in the United States, with at least one 24-hour ED. The dataset includes demographics, up to 16 drugs involved in the ED visit, toxicology confirmation, route of administration, type of case, and disposition of the patient following the visit.",

The KID enables studies of specific conditions, procedures, and subpopulations that often cannot be assessed with other databases because children account for a relatively small proportion of hospital stays. \r\n\r\nUsing the KID, it is possible to study varied topics including the incidence of uncommon conditions such as congenital anomalies, the economic burden associated with specific procedures or conditions such as adolescent pregnancy, and the pediatric conditions most often associated with particular outcomes such as death in the hospital.\r\n\r\nThe KID is the only all-payer inpatient care database for children in the United States.  It is a sample of pediatric discharges from 2,500-4,000 U.S. hospitals yielding approximately two to three million unweighted hospital discharges for children per year.  About 10 percent of normal newborns and 80 percent of other neonatal and pediatric stays are selected from each hospital that is sampled.  \r\n\r\nThe KID contains clinical and resource use information included in a typical discharge abstract, with safeguards to protect the privacy of individual patients, physicians, and hospitals (as required by data sources).  It includes charge information on all patients, regardless of payer, including children covered by Medicaid, private insurance, and the uninsured.

PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

Temperature data are available in Fahrenheit or Celsius scales. Reported measures are the average temperature, number of observations, and range for the daily maximum and minimum air temperatures, and also percent coverage for the daily maximum heat index. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified maximum and minimum air temperature, and heat index value. The data are derived from the North America Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS) through NLDAS Phase 2, a collaboration project among several groups: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Environmental Modeling Center (EMC), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Princeton University, the National Weather Service (NWS) Office of Hydrological Development (OHD), the University of Washington, and the NCEP Climate Prediction Center (CPC). In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program/Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center/ Universities Space Research Association developed the analysis to produce the data available on CDC WONDER.",

Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999. Obtain population counts by Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year or 5-year groups). The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.",

    "description": "The Daily Fine Particulate Matter data available on CDC WONDER are geographically aggregated daily measures of fine particulate matter in the outdoor air, spanning the years 2003-2008. PM2.5 particles are air pollutants with an aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 micrometers. Reported measures are the daily measure of fine particulate matter in micrograms per cubic meter (PM2.5) (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3), the number of observations, minimum and maximum range value, and standard deviation. Data are available by place (combined 48 contiguous states plus the District of Columbia, region, division, state, county), time (year, month, day) and specified fine particulate matter (''\u00c2\u00b5g/m''\u00c2\u00b3)value. County-level and higher data are aggregated from 10 kilometer square spatial resolution grids. In a study funded by the NASA Applied Sciences Program / Public Health Program, scientists at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center / Universities Space Research Association modified the regional surfacing algorithm of Al-Hamdan et al. (2009) and used it to generate continuous spatial surfaces (grids) of daily PM2.5 for the whole conterminous U.S. for 2003-2008. Two sources of environmental data were used as input to the surfacing algorithm, US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Air Quality System (AQS) PM2.5 in-situ data and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth remotely sensed data. They also identified in a Geographic Information System (GIS) the associated geographic locations of the centroids of the gridded PM2.5 dataset in terms of the counties and states they fall into to enable aggregation to different geographic levels in CDC WONDER.",

MPR is using the Medicaid Analytic eXtract (MAX) data files for calendar year 1999 and later years for these research products. The MAX files are constructed from claims and eligibility data that states submit to CMS electronically through the Medicaid Statistical Information System (MSIS).  One set of products is the Statistical Compendium:  Medicaid Pharmacy Benefit Use and Reimbursement (hereafter \"the Compendium\") for calendar years 1999 and 2001-2007.  The Compendium for each year provides detailed state-by-state and national data on the use of and reimbursement for prescription drugs in Medicaid.  (A Compendium was not produced for calendar year 2000.)  Using the detailed data from the Compendium, MPR has also prepared Chartbooks for 1999 and 2001-2007.

Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.",

The surveys are designed to provide quarterly, as well as annual, estimates. Information is provided on the use of illicit drugs, alcohol, and tobacco among members of United States households aged 12 and older. Questions included age at first use as well as lifetime, annual, and past-month usage for the following drug classes: marijuana, cocaine (and crack), hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of prescription drugs, including pain relievers, tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives. The survey covers substance abuse treatment history and perceived need for treatment, and includes questions from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that allow diagnostic criteria to be applied. The survey included questions concerning treatment for both substance abuse and mental health-related disorders. Respondents were also asked about personal and family income sources and amounts, health care access and coverage, illegal activities and arrest record, problems resulting from the use of drugs, and needle-sharing.",

Congress and OMB now use performance information to support budget decisions.

FDA receives some adverse event and medication error reports directly from health care professionals (such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses and others) and consumers (such as patients, family members, lawyers and others). Healthcare professionals and consumers may also report these events to the products' manufacturers. If a manufacturer receives an adverse event report, it is required to send the report to FDA as specified by regulations.  The files listed on this page contain raw data extracted from the AERS database for the indicated time ranges and are not cumulative. Users of these files need to be familiar with creation of relational databases using applications such as ORACLE, Microsoft Office Access, MySQL and IBM DB2 or the use of ASCII files with SAS analytic tools.

These estimates result from \"bridging\" the 31 race categories used in Census 2000, as specified in the 1997 Office of Management and Budget (OMB) standards for the collection of data on race and ethnicity, to the four race categories specified under the 1977 standards (Asian or Pacific Islander, Black or African American, American Indian or Alaska Native, White). Many data systems, such as vital statistics, are continuing to use the 1977 OMB standards during the transition to full implementation of the 1997 OMB standards. Postcensal estimates are available for year 2000 - 2009; intercensal estimates are available for the years 1990-1999.  Obtain population counts by  Year, State, County, Race (4-categories), Ethnicity, Sex and Age (1-year or 5-year groups).   The data are released by the National Center for Health Statistics.",

    "title": "QuitNowTXT Text Messaging Library",
    "description": "Overview: The QuitNowTXT text messaging program is designed as a resource that can be adapted to specific contexts including those outside the United States and in languages other than English. Based on evidence-based practices, this program is a smoking cessation intervention for smokers who are ready to quit smoking. Although evidence supports the use of text messaging as a platform to deliver cessation interventions, it is expected that the maximum effect of the program will be demonstrated when it is integrated into other elements of a national tobacco control strategy.  The QuitNowTXT program is designed to deliver tips, motivation, encouragement and fact-based information via unidirectional and interactive bidirectional message formats. The core of the program consists of messages sent to the user based on a scheduled quit day identified by the user. Messages are sent for up to four weeks pre-quit date and up to six weeks post quit date. Messages assessing mood, craving, and smoking status are also sent at various intervals, and the user receives messages back based on the response they have submitted. In addition, users can request assistance in dealing with craving, stress/mood, and responding to slips/relapses by texting specific key words to the QuitNow. Rotating automated messages are then returned to the user based on the keyword. Details of the program are provided below. Texting STOP to the service discontinues further texts being sent.  This option is provided every few messages as required by the United States cell phone providers.  It is not an option to remove this feature if the program is used within the US.  If a web-based registration is used, it is suggested that users provide demographic information such as age, gender, and smoking frequency (daily or almost every day, most days, only a few days a week, only on weekends, a few times a month or less) in addition to their mobile phone number and quit date. This information will be useful for assessing the reach of the program, as well as identifying possible need to develop libraries to specific groups. The use of only a mobile phone-based registration system reduces barriers for participant entry into the program but limits the collection of additional data. At bare minimum, quit date must be collected.  At sign up, participants will have the option to choose a quit date up to one month out. Text messages will start up to 14 days before their specified quit date. Users also have the option of changing their quit date at any time if desired. The program can also be modified to provide texts to users who have already quit within the last month.  One possible adaptation of the program is to include a QuitNowTXT \"light\" version. This adaptation would allow individuals who do not have unlimited text messaging capabilities but would still like to receive support to participate by controlling the number of messages they receive. In the light program, users can text any of the programmed keywords without fully opting in to the program. Program Design: The program is designed as a 14-day countdown to quit date, with subsequent six weeks of daily messages. Each day within the program is identified as either a pre-quit date (Q- # days) or a post-quit date (Q+#). If a user opts into the program fewer than 14 days before their quit date, the system will begin sending messages on that day. For example, if they opt in four days prior to their quit date, the system will send a welcome message and recognize that they are at Q-4 (or four days before their quit date), and they will receive the message that everyone else receives four days before their quit date. As the user progresses throughout the program, they will receive messages outlined in the text message library. Throughout the program, users will receive texts that cover a variety of content areas including tips, informational content, motivational messaging, and keyword responses. The frequency of messages increases as the days leading up to and following the user's quit date, with a heavy emphasis on support, efficacy building, and actionable tips. Further away from a user's quit date, the messages will reduce in frequency. If the user says they have started to smoke again, the system will give them the option of continuing the program as planned or starting over and setting a new quit date.  The system is also designed to assess the user's mood, craving level, and smoking status several times during the program. These assessment messages are characterized as MOOD, CRAVE, and STATUS messages. Whenever the system asks for a response from the user, it will send a programmed response based on the user's answer (i.e., if the user responds with MOOD = BAD then they will receive a message customized to that response). These programmed response messages rotate throughout the course of the program. Users can also send the system one of three programmed keywords (CRAVE, MOOD, and SLIP), and the system will send unique, automated responses based on the texted keyword. There are 10 messages for each of the programmed keywords, which rotate on a random basis, decreasing the likelihood the user will get the same response in a row.  After the full six-week program comes to an end, the system will follow up at one, three, and six months to check on the user's smokefree status and offer additional assistance if needed.  Message Types: -'''\u00a2 Tips: Tips provide users with actionable strategies on how to manage cravings and deal with quitting smoking in general. -'''\u00a2 Motivation/encouragement: Motivational messages encourage users to keep going on their smokefree journey despite the difficulty and struggle they may be facing. -'''\u00a2 Information: Informational messages provide users with facts and other salient points about the impact of smoking relevant to their socio-cultural environment. -'''\u00a2 Assessment: The assessment messages are built into the text messaging program and are designed to collect information about the user's experience as they are quitting and provide immediate feedback based on the user's response. Assessment messages fall along three dimensions: mood, craving, and smoking status. -'''\u00a2 Reactive Messaging (Key Words): At any point, the user can initiate an interaction with the program that will return a text message relevant to the user's request for help. In response to the user texting one of the key words, the system will send them unique, automated responses. The key words cover topics relevant to various aspects of cessation.",

Special focus areas on diabetes, asthma, Healthy People 2010, clinical preventive services, disparities, payer, and variation over time are also featured.

The most important aspects of this file are as follow: 1. It contains claims for a simple random sample of 5% of the 2008 beneficiary population. Out of approximately 2.4 million beneficiaries in the 5% sample, about 350,000 had claims (after excluding a relatively small fraction of ineligible claims), resulting in a Public Use File of just under 590,000 claims. 2. It contains six (6) analytic variables (in addition to an encrypted claim key): Age, gender, base DRG code, ICD-9 code, claim cost, and length of inpatient stay. All of these variables, except gender, have been suitably aggregated or averaged in order to protect individuals from identification, while retaining the analytic value of the data. 3. A claim for a sampled beneficiary is only included in the PUF if the combination of all six (6) variables is shared by at least eleven (11) claims pertaining to at least eleven (11) distinct beneficiaries in the population (but not necessarily the sample). 4. Claims cannot be linked by beneficiary, and cannot be linked to any external data source by means of the claim ID. The claim ID is a cryptographic key specific to this Inpatient Claims PUF and not available elsewhere. The inpatient Claims PUF is sorted by this claim ID to ensure that the relative position of claims in the PUF and the original source data are totally uncorrelated.",
