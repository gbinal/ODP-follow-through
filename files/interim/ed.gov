    "description": "The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS), Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 followed a nationally representative sample of children who were kindergartners in 1998-99 from kindergarten through eighth grade. The base-year sample included more than 21,000 children attending more than 1,200 public and private schools.  Data were collected from children, their families, their teachers, and their schools at multiple points in time (i.e., fall and spring kindergarten, fall and spring first grade, spring third grade, spring fifth grade, spring eighth grade).  The ECLS-K program provides national data on children's transition to school and their  experiences and growth through the eighth grade. The ECLS program also provides data to analyze the relationships among a wide range of family, school, community, and child characteristics with children's development, learning, and performance in school.\r",

Family and community supports must include programs to improve student health, safety, community stability, family and community engagement, and student access to 21st century learning tools. The continuum of solutions also must be linked and integrated seamlessly so there are common outcomes, a focus on similar milestones, support during transitional time periods, and no time or resource gaps that create obstacles for students in making academic progress.

Topics in the Digest include: the number of schools and colleges; teachers; enrollments; graduates; educational attainment; finances; federal funds for education; employment and income of graduates; libraries; technology; and international comparisons.\r\rThe 2009 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics is the 45th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the Digest, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the Digest contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices.",

    "description": "This annual report provides a compilation of 435 downloadable tables of statistical information covering the broad field of education from prekindergarten through graduate school. Topics in the Digest include: the number of schools and colleges; teachers; enrollments; graduates; educational attainment; finances; federal funds for education; employment and income of graduates; libraries; technology; and international comparisons.\r\rThe 2010 edition of the Digest of Education Statistics is the 46th in a series of publications initiated in 1962. The Digest has been issued annually except for combined editions for the years 1977-78, 1983-84, and 1985-86. Its primary purpose is to provide a compilation of statistical information covering the broad field of American education from prekindergarten through graduate school. The Digest includes a selection of data from many sources, both government and private, and draws especially on the results of surveys and activities carried out by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES). To qualify for inclusion in the Digest, material must be nationwide in scope and of current interest and value. The publication contains information on a variety of subjects in the field of education statistics, including the number of schools and colleges, teachers, enrollments, and graduates, in addition to data on educational attainment, finances, federal funds for education, libraries, and international comparisons. Supplemental information on population trends, attitudes on education, education characteristics of the labor force, government finances, and economic trends provides background for evaluating education data. Although the Digest contains important information on federal education funding, more detailed information on federal activities is available from federal education program offices.",

Ready to Learn Television supports the development of educational television and digital media targeted at preschool and early elementary school children and their families. Its general goal is to promote early learning and school readiness, with a particular interest in reaching low-income children. In addition to creating television and other media products, the program supports activities intended to promote national distribution of the programming, effective educational uses of the programming, community-based outreach, and research on educational effectiveness. You can use the tools below to look at general information about the grant applications that were submitted in June 2010. There were a total of 38 eligible applications, of which three were selected for funding. In this 2010 competition, applicants were invited to submit proposals for the development of innovative transmedia programming - that is, the use of television and other media such as the internet, mobile devices, and print in interconnected ways. In the 2010 grant competition, there was a two-tier review process in which the applications that scored the highest against the program's general review criteria were advanced to a second tier in which their responses to the competitive preference priority on research were scored. In the data summaries below, applicants that advanced to tier two are denoted as \"highly rated applicants,\" and those that received awards are listed as \"grantees\". The data presented here is sourced from the applications submitted to the program. The data may not be a full representation of the information provided in the formal application. Inclusion of an application in this summary information is not an endorsement of an organization, idea, program, or product, and the Department does not validate or guarantee the accuracy of this information. The data are provided in this summary solely for the convenience of the public. For more information about the Ready to Learn program, go to http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/rtltv\/index.html.",

Each record is uniquely defined by the variables IPEDS ID (UNITID), classification of instructional program (CIPCODE), first or second major (MAJORNUM) and award level (AWLEVEL). In 2009-10 institutions had the choice of using the old race\/ethnicity categories or the new new race\/ethnicity categories or a mix of old and new to report completions data. Each record will contain both old and new categories and a set of derived variables that combine both old and new. The set of race\/ethnicity variables that will be used in IPEDS publications during these optional reporting years will be the derived set of variables, the two or more race category from the new reporting method, race\/ethnicity unknown and Nonresident Aliens. These variables will sum to the total awards on each record.",

    "description": "Since President Obama took office, Congress has appropriated more than $4 billion to help turn around the nation's lowest-performing schools. States were awarded nearly $3.5 billion in School Improvement Grant funds in 2010 to turn around their persistently lowest achieving schools. School districts then applied to state for the funds this spring. When school districts applied, they were required to indicate that they would implement one of the following four models in their persistently lowest achieving schools: Turnaround Model: Replace the principal, screen existing school staff, and rehire no more than half the teachers; adopt a new governance structure; and improve the school through curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies. Restart Model: Convert a school or close it and re-open it as a charter school or under an education management organization. School Closure: Close the school and send the students to higher-achieving schools in the district. Transformation Model: Replace the principal and improve the school through comprehensive curriculum reform, professional development, extending learning time, and other strategies.",

    "description": "Thank you for your interest in Early Learning! A robust body of research demonstrates that high-quality early learning programs and services can improve young children's health, social-emotional, and cognitive outcomes; enhance school readiness across a range of domains; and help close the school readiness gap that exists between children with high needs and their peers at the time they enter kindergarten. To address the inequities that exist when children begin school, the Department has identified, as high priorities, strengthening the quality early learning programs from birth through third grade. You can use the tools below to look at individual discretionary grant programs that focus on or include early learning. The data is sourced from supplemental forms as reported by applicants. The data from these forms may not be a full or accurate representation of the information provided in the formal application. If you believe your data is misrepresented, please use our feedback form to report this. We'll contact you to discuss the corrections. Indian Education - Demonstration Grants for Indian Children (http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/indiandemo\/index.html): This program is designed to improve the education opportunities and achievement of preschool, elementary, and secondary school Indian children by developing, testing, and demonstrating effective services and programs. Indian Education Professional Development Grants (http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/indianprofdev\/index.html): The Indian Education Professional Development grant program is designed to prepare and train Indians to serve as teachers and school administrators. Professional development grants are awarded to: increase the number of qualified individuals in professions that serve American Indians; provide training to qualified American Indians to become teachers, administrators, teacher aides, social workers, and ancillary education personnel; and improve the skills of those qualified American Indians who already serve in these capacities. Investing in Innovation (i3) (http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/innovation\/index.html): This program provides funding to expand the implementation of, and investment in, innovative and evidence-based practices, programs and strategies that significantly improve student achievement and close achievement gaps. Competitive preference has been given in the past to applicants whose projects propose to implement innovative practices, strategies, or programs designed to improve outcomes for young children with high needs from birth through 3rd grade by enhancing the quality of early learning programs. For the complete i3 dataset, go to Investing In Innovation 2011 Applications Native Hawaiian Education (http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/nathawaiian\/index.html): The purpose of this program is to develop innovative education programs to assist native Hawaiians and to supplement and expand programs and authorities in the area of education.

Funds may support the study of Native American languages. Promise Neighborhoods (http:\/\/www2.ed.gov\/programs\/promiseneighborhoods\/index.html): Promise Neighborhood grants are separated into two categories: planning and implementation. Planning grants are one-year awards to support eligible organizations that need to develop feasible plans to create a continuum of solutions with the potential to significantly improve the educational and developmental outcomes of children and youth in a neighborhood, while implementation grants are three- to five-year awards to support eligible organizations in carrying out their plans to create a continuum of solutions that will significantly improve the educational and developmental outcomes of children and youth in the target neighborhood. In the past, priority has been given to applicants who propose to expand, enhance, or modify an existing network of early learning programs and services to ensure that they are high-quality and comprehensive for children from birth through the third grade.
