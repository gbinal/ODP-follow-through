	"description": "The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) records and stores information about Veterans with substance abuse problems. Substance abuse patients are administered a standard questionnaire of approximately 200 questions. Answers are recorded by a clinician in the ASI database running at the local Veterans Affairs Medical Center (VAMC). Questions deal directly with substance abuse and include the following: 1) The identification of substances that are or have been used 2) The impact of substance abuse on a patient's life and on his/her family 3) Determining whether a patient has had legal problems 4) Recording if the patient has had problems with employment because of substance abuse. Information is transmitted weekly from the local VAMC to the ASI. The ASI is co-located with the Mental Health Field Based Program Office at the Pittsburgh VAMC. The information stored in ASI is considered highly sensitive. One large consumer of the data collected in the ASI is the Performance Evaluation Resource Center (PERC) located in Palo Alto, California. The PERC uses the information to evaluate the performance of individual programs in the field. Since 1997, patient data collected about substance abuse has been stored in ASI. Prior to 1997, substance abuse information was co-located with the information about posttraumatic stress disorder in the National Mental Health Database System.",

A weekly download of the accident reports are sent to the national database using MailMan messages. On a monthly basis, extracts are sent to the ASISTS central repository located at the Austin Information Technology Center. The VHA Support Service Center (VSSC) provides multiple customized reports on the VSSC Web portal available on the VA Intranet.

Presently, however, VHA�s approach to data management is fragmented and inefficient.  To improve our capacity to leverage data and analysis to provide the most efficient and the highest quality health care to our Veteran patients, VHA is pursuing an enterprise-wide approach that views certain key data as a strategic assets.   Central to this strategy is consolidating data from disparate sources into a coherent single logical data model.    The Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) is the physical implementation of this logical data model at the enterprise level for VHA.   Although the CDW initially began to store data as early as 2006, a renewed effort began in 2010 to accelerate CDW�s content by including more subject areas from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) and content from other existing national data systems.   CDW supports fully developed subject areas in its production environment as well as supporting rapid prototyping by extracting data directly from source systems with very minor data transformations.    The Regional Data Warehouses and the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) Data Warehouses share content from CDW and allow for greater reporting flexibility at the local level throughout the VHA organization.",

Even though the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention characterized the risk of transmission of CJD from blood derivative products as 'small and immeasurable' and 'theoretical', VA believed it had an ethical obligation to inform patients of the exposure to potentially contaminated blood components or plasma derivative products while under VA's care. The patients were notified. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) established a tracking system for individuals who received these products to determine if there was an increase in VA CJD cases. Every two years (odd years), the Infectious Diseases Program Office requests from field facilities through the appropriate Network Office an update on the status of patients who had previously been identified through the VA CJD lookback notification initiative. The Infectious Diseases Program Office receives the information and provides summary reports to the VHA Chief Patient Care Services Officer. Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease Lookback Dataset (CJDLD) is a retrospective collection of data and requests for individual reports are not accepted.",

The DEMPS Program may be used for an internal VA mission, as well as supporting a mission after a Presidential Disaster Declaration under the National Response Frameworks Emergency Support Function #8 (Public Health and Medical Services). Interested, qualified VHA staff can apply online by submitting a DEMPS Application. DEMPS Coordinators and Administrators can manage volunteer data by accessing DEMPS Administration.The DEMPS Program is made up of the following entities:The DEMPS Volunteers (Full-time VHA employee, or Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps Volunteer (ERC)) VAMC DEMPS Coordinator DEMPS VAMC Facility Support Staff (Fiscal, Payroll, and Travel) DEMPS VISN Points of Contact DEMPS National Program Manager VHA Office of Emergency Management staff (Area Emergency Managers, and Regional Emergency Managers) Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Operations and Management, and The DEMPS database. In order for DEMPS to work successfully, all eight entities above must work together to deploy the DEMPS Volunteer to an emergency or disaster site.The DEMPS database was developed to collect specific information on full-time VHA medical personnel (clinical and non-clinical) and Retiree Emergency Reserve Corps (ERC) Volunteers who have volunteered and been approved by their Medical Center Director to be deployed (full-time staff or ERC Volunteers) in the event of a disaster, or to back fill a medical center (ERC Volunteers). When disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, etc., occur and the state and local resources to handle the response/recovery process are overwhelmed, the state in which the disaster occurs may request federal assistance. In this case, a Presidential Disaster Declaration is issued and the National Response Framework (NRF) is activated. Once the damage to the area and needs have been assessed, and it is determined that medical resources are required, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) may task VA to provide these resources. Generally, these requests are for medical personnel (nurses, physicians, pharmacists, etc.), pharmaceutical (or other medical) supplies, and medical equipment. However, depending on the mission, VHA may deploy non-clinical staff to support the infrastructure of the deployment.",

The database stores medically useful information about the patients and their pacemaker test results in order to highlight serial changes, which determine whether the pacemaker is still functioning normally, or whether the patient requires further intervention. The EPSC staff performs regular telephonic checkups, in conjunction with less frequent in-hospital clinic checkups, to determine when pacemakers need to be replaced. Patients are scheduled and called by the Pacemaker Surveillance Center, and have their electrocardiogram recorded and analyzed over the phone, using wires attached to their fingers and a VHA-supplied transmitter.  Additionally, some patients are monitored via web-based downloads of their device telemetry.  The Pacemaker Center also provides in-hospital clinic checkups for local Washington DC VHA pacemaker patients. All information obtained during the checkups is recorded in the EPSC Database. The database also contains records of pacemaker patients being monitored by VHA facilities east of the Mississippi and who are not being monitored directly by their respective VA medical centers. The VHA Department of Medical Services encourages local VHA medical centers to refer their patients for pacemaker follow-up monitoring to either the Eastern Surveillance Center or to the counterpart Western Surveillance Center in San Francisco, whichever is geographically appropriate. However, referral is optional. The database also maintains a registry of all VHA patients, living and deceased, who have had pacemakers implanted at, or who have been monitored by, VHA facilities. The EPSC receives information for the registry directly from the medical centers for patients that it does not monitor, totaling over 80,000 as of 2010.",

Studies have shown that embedded fragments are not inert in the body, but may breakdown slowly over time and potentially affect an individual�s health. The recognition of potential short and long-term health effects of embedded fragments and the large number of soldiers with injuries resulting in embedded fragments led the Presidential Task Force on Returning Global War on Terror Heroes to recommend that the VHA establish a registry and medical surveillance program for Veterans with retained fragments. The Toxic Embedded Fragment Surveillance Center (TEFSC) has been established at the Baltimore VA Medical Center to coordinate this charge. A critical component of the TEFSC medical surveillance program is the development of an Embedded Fragment Registry. This registry provides a mechanism to identify Veterans with embedded fragments, manage clinical data related to embedded fragments, and develop medical and surgical guidelines that will enable the TEFSC staff and VA clinicians to deliver appropriate medical care to these Veterans.",

These files are manipulated and used for analysis and reporting by the National Infectious Diseases Service. Emerging Pathogens (as characterized by VACO) act as triggers for data acquisition activities in the automated program. The system retrieves relevant, predetermined, patient-specific information in the form of a Health Level Seven (HL7) message that is transmitted to the central data repository at the AITC. Once at that location, the data is converted to a SAS dataset for analysis by the VACO National Infectious Diseases Service.

The HBPC information system is referred to as HBC at the VA Austin Information Technology Center and as HBHC at the local level. The HBHC automated a paper-based system of reporting home care episodes. When an admission form is completed, an episode is opened and input into HBHC for a potential home care patient. The patient is evaluated and accepted to or rejected from the program. When a patient leaves the program for any reason an episode is closed and a discharge form completed and input into HBHC. HBHC runs a nightly extract of information within the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture. Extractions include information on all Patient Care Encounters (PCEs) with the patient and home visits made by home care providers. Details of which provider(s) made the visit, the date, any diagnosis and any procedures performed are included. Each local application sends its data to the Austin HBC database on a monthly basis.

It contains data for the tracking, trending and monitoring of accreditation and certification of facilities participating in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Mammography Program. Information is obtained from Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture Decision Support System (DSS) Radiology extracts. This information details how often mammography is performed and in which facility and VISN, based from Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code nomenclature. Specific items include, but are not limited to: CPT code(s); medical facility; date of procedure(s); types of imaging procedure(s) and/or biopsy(ies) performed and the facility performing the procedure(s). While the American College of Radiology (ACR) is the primary accrediting institution for all mammography suites in the country, it is the sole accrediting institution for the VHA mammography sites. The ACR independently gathers information from all VAMCs with on-site mammography and sends information weekly to the MQS VA. Forty-five VHA sites are accredited and certified. The ACR uses the information to determine clinical image quality, standards compliance, equipment functional parameters, etc. as a basis for awarding accreditation. The MQS VA data is used to monitor the equipment performance, staff Quality Control (QC) and Quality Assurance (QA) requirements. Accreditation requires the review of clinical images, staff credentials, phantom image assessment, etc. triennially with annual updates. Certification, on the other hand, requires the facility to maintain accreditation, obtain an annual medical physicist survey of mammography equipment and undergo an annual inspection conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The MQS VA data allows the Diagnostic Services, National Radiology Program, which certifies mammography facilities, to notify the VAMCs when their performance reaches levels that may cause substandard images resulting in the potential loss of accreditation and certification. An enhancement to the database has been implemented that adds the results from the annual on-site FDA inspections of VAMC mammography suites. The FDA will send to MQS VA the inspection/test results and the results are added to the database. This will allow the MQS VA to notify VAMCs of identified deficiencies and assure that issues affecting quality mammography are corrected.",

Data recorded in the VistA Patient Care Encounter (PCE) package, which captures clinical data resulting from ambulatory care patient encounters is transmitted to the NPCD using the Ambulatory Care Reporting (ACR) Module of the VistA Patient Information Management System (PIMS) package. The Ambulatory Care Reporting Module provides necessary information on patient treatment, what services were rendered to patients, who provided the services, and whether services reported were synchronized with the VA medical center database. Directive 2006-026 (05/05/2006) required the inclusion to patient care data capture requirements the capture of inpatient encounters for patients seen in outpatient clinics and inpatient billable professional services.Additionally, NPCD includes VistA Spinal Cord Dysfunction (SCD) package and Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) data. The SCD central registry in NPCD is used to provide VA-wide review of patient demographics, clinical aspects of injury and disease, and resource utilization involved in providing care to patients.   As of October 2010, data for the Spinal Cord Dysfunction is being maintained in the Spinal Cord Injury and Disorders Outcomes (SCIDO) database; current SCD data in NPCD is residual data only.  The data load and extraction process for SCD data in NPCD will be discontinued in FY12. The PCMM data in NPCD includes primary care patient to provider assignments and provider utilization data.The NPCD is used by Veterans Health Administration (VHA) program offices for a wide variety of tasks to include research and budget allocation to medical centers.",

	"description": "The National Prosthetics Patient Database (NPPD) established a central database of Prosthetics data recorded at each Veterans Health Administration facility. Its objective was to enable clinical reviews to increase quality, reduce costs, and improve efficiency of the Prosthetics program. Increase the quality of the services to our Veterans by providing a means to develop consistency in services, review prescription and management practices, develop training, monitor Home Medical Equipment, and measure performance improvements. Reduce costs by comparing costs system-wide, identifying common items for consolidated contracting, identifying costs for Medical Cost Care Funds (MCCF) purposes and improving contracting cost benefit. Improve efficiency by validating the data, improving budget management, determining where coding errors occur, providing training, and comparing unique social security numbers for multiple site usage and item issue. The NPPD Menu provides patient information, patient eligibility, Prosthetic treatment, date of provision, cost, vendor, and purchasing agent information. This system tracks average cost data and its usage and provides on both a monthly and quarterly basis detailed and summary reports by station, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN) and agency. The NPPD Menu resides in Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) at the medical center level. This data is updated quarterly. Data is rolled up at each facility and transmitted to Hines. The data is then loaded into the Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW) from which data extracts are done. The data is also put into a ProClarity cube and is available to VA local, regional, and national managers online. National managers have the ability to properly monitor, oversee and manage the national program and regional managers are able to effectively manage their respective areas using this tool. The primary purpose of this database is to provide financial and clinical oversight of the Prosthetics program and is used primarily by the Prosthetics and Sensory Aids (PSA) including VISN staff, VISN Prosthetics Representatives, Prosthetics Program Managers and other Prosthetics staff.",

	"description": "The Nuclear Medicine National HQ System database is a series of MS Excel spreadsheets and Access Database Tables by fiscal year. They consist of information from all Veterans Affairs Medical Centers (VAMCs) performing or contracting nuclear medicine services in Veterans Affairs medical facilities. The medical centers are required to complete questionnaires annually (RCS 10-0010-Nuclear Medicine Service Annual Report). The information is then manually entered into the Access Tables, which includes: * Distribution and cost of in-house VA - Contract Physician Services, whether contracted services are made via sharing agreement (with another VA medical facility or other government medical providers) or with private providers. * Workload data for the performance and/or purchase of PET/CT studies. * Organizational structure of services. * Updated changes in key imaging service personnel (chiefs, chief technicians, radiation safety officers). * Workload data on the number and type of studies (scans) performed, including Medicare Relative Value Units (RVUs), also referred to as Weighted Work Units (WWUs). WWUs are a workload measure calculated as the product of a study's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) code, which consists of total work costs (the cost of physician medical expertise and time), and total practice costs (the costs of running a practice, such as equipment, supplies, salaries, utilities etc). Medicare combines WWUs together with one other parameter to derive RVUs, a workload measure widely used in the health care industry. WWUs allow Nuclear Medicine to account for the complexity of each study in assessing workload, that some studies are more time consuming and require higher levels of expertise. This gives a more accurate picture of workload; productivity etc than using just 'total studies' would yield. * A detailed Full-Time Equivalent Employee (FTEE) grid, and staffing distributions of FTEEs across nuclear medicine services. * Information on Radiation Safety Committees and Radiation Safety Officers (RSOs).  Beginning in 2011 this will include data collection on part-time and non VA (contract) RSOs; other affiliations they may have and if so to whom they report (supervision) at their VA medical center.*Collection of data on nuclear medicine services' progress in meeting the special needs of our female veterans.* Revolving documentation of all major VA-owned gamma cameras (by type) and computer systems, their specifications and ages. * Revolving data collection for PET/CT cameras owned or leased by VA; and the numbers and types of PET/CT studies performed on VA patients whether produced on-site, via mobile PET/CT contract or from non-VA providers in the community.* Types of educational training/certification programs available at VA sites * Ongoing funded research projects by Nuclear Medicine (NM) staff, identified by source of funding and research purpose. * Data on physician-specific quality indicators at each nuclear medicine service.* Academic achievements by NM staff, including published books/chapters, journals and abstracts. * Information from polling field sites re: relevant issues and programs Headquarters needs to address. * Results of a Congressionally mandated contracted quality assessment exercise, also known as a Proficiency study. Study results are analyzed for comparison within VA facilities (for example by mission or size), and against participating private sector health care groups. * Information collected on current issues in nuclear medicine as they arise.  Radiation Safety Committee structures and membership, Radiation Safety Officer information and information on how nuclear medicine services provided for female Veterans are examples of current issues.The database is now stored completely within MS Access Database Tables with output still presented in the form of Excel graphs and tables.",

	"title": "VA National Clozapine Registry",
	"description": "The VA National Clozapine Registry tracks the health and demographics of patients who have been prescribed clozapine by the VA. Clozapine, or the brand name Clozaril, is a drug used to treat the most serious cases of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, clozapine may also affect portions of the blood, lowering the body's resistance to infection and sometimes creating life-threatening circumstances. Realizing the severity of the problem, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) established guidelines for analysis of White Blood Cells and Neutrophils and set strict minimum limits. The FDA also mandated that any manufacturer of clozapine must maintain a Clozapine Registry. These registries are to track the location and the health of clozapine patients and to ensure 'weekly White Blood Cell testing prior to delivery of the next week's supply of medication'. To date, the clozapine manufacturer registries have been unable to develop sufficient controls to meet these requirements, especially the ability to prevent dispensing clozapine when blood results are abnormal. However, because of the unique structure of Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture, the Veterans Health Administration obtained permission from the FDA and clozapine manufacturers to use its in-place computer network to gather and evaluate weekly patient information, then export this data to manufacturer clozapine registries. The VA assigned functional administration of this effort to the National Clozapine Coordinating Center (NCCC) located in Dallas, Texas. Weekly data on each VA clozapine patient is processed at two locations. Facility Level --When a clozapine prescription is written, a computer program in each facility's internal computer system retrieves white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and clozapine dose and evaluates the information according to FDA guidelines. If an adverse blood condition is found, the computer may warn to trigger a physician reevaluation, or lock out entirely to prevent dispensing, depending on the severity. Weekly, this information, along with certain patient demographic information, is gathered locally and transmitted to Hines Office of Information & Technology Field Office for centralized storage. This data can only be accessed by the NCCC. Raw data is downloaded from the Hines OI Field Office database on a weekly basis. An ancillary computer program reformats the data and evaluates the information for inconsistencies and data gathering errors. The computer-corrected data is manually compared with hand-written facsimile information sent to the NCCC by each site. This manually corrected data is again reformatted for data storage in MS Access format at the NCCC. The corrected data is also reformatted into American Standard Code for Information Interchange fixed-length fields and transmitted via modem to the manufacturers' Clozapine Registry and, in turn, to the FDA.",

OHRS is a web-based application that enables employee occupational health staff to create, maintain, and monitor medical records for VA employees and generate national, Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN), and site-specific reports.The focus of OHRS is to collect clinical data for wellness, medical surveillance, and appropriate treatment of work-based injury or illness. OHRS will capture and store information on patient encounters, such as encounter type, purpose, status, provider, and other pertinent clinical data obtained during the patient visit. Users with appropriate security privileges are allowed to add and sign or co-sign the encounter and, if needed, perform scheduled and unscheduled reporting on items such as vaccination rates, vaccination and immunity statuses. The OHRS application does not share patient-specific data, but will collect data elements limited to information deemed critical to the Occupational Health delivery of care processes in the OHRS database. Employee data is obtained from the central Personnel and Accounting Integrated Data System (PAID) while volunteer information is obtained from the Voluntary Service System (VSS). Other Non-Paid and non-VSS data is collected by direct data entry into OHRS at the time of the patient encounter. OHRS is further designed to document, track and report immunizations administered to other Federal Agency employees outside of VA.",

	"description": "The Patient Assessment File (PAF) database compiles the results of the Patient Assessment Instrument (PAI) questionnaire filled out for intermediate care Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients. The PAI is filled out within two weeks of admission. It is also completed semi-annually on April 1st and October 1st for each patient by a registered nurse familiar with the patient. The PAI questions cover medical treatments, conditions, selected diagnoses, activities of daily living, behaviors, some rehabilitation therapies, and chronic respiratory support. The database is managed by the Geriatrics & Extended Care Strategic Health Care Group in the Office of Patient Care Services. It is currently running at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC) and is stored in flat files. PAF's primary customer is the Allocation Resource Center (ARC) in Braintree MA. The ARC receives the data from AITC and combines it with data from the Patient Treatment File (PTF) which contains more detailed demographic and treatment information. The ARC builds ORACLE tables, assigning RUG II (Resource Utilization Group II) scores and weighted work units reflecting the level and type of care needed. The 16 different weighted work units, ranging from 479 to 1800, are a factor in the resource allocation and budget decisions on long-term care, and are used to measure efficiency. The data is also used in other reports to Central Office, the Veterans Integrated Service Networks, and the facilities. Several other units also use PAF information including the Decision Support System (DSS). Currently, PAF is in the process of being replaced by the Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS). RAI/MDS uses a much more extensive questionnaire as its source of information. The RAI/MDS provides clinical data and care protocols in addition to the newer RUG III scores, and is required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service funded hospitals.",

	"description": "The Resident Assessment Instrument/Minimum Data Set (RAI/MDS) is a comprehensive assessment and care planning process used by the nursing home industry since 1990 as a requirement for nursing home participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The RAI/MDS provides data for monitoring changes in resident status that are consistent and reliable over time. The VA commitment to quality propelled the implementation of the RAI/MDS in its nursing homes now known as VA Community Living Centers (CLC). In addition to providing consistent clinical information, the RAI/MDS can be used as a measure of both quality and resource utilization, thereby serving as a benchmark for quality and cost data within the VA as well as with community based nursing facilities. Workload based on RAI/MDS can be calculated electronically by the interactions of the elements of the MDS data and grouped into 53 categories referred to as Resource Utilization Groups (RUG-IV). Residents are assessed quarterly. The data is grouped for analysis at the Austin Information Technology Center (AITC). Conversion to electronic data entry and transmission to the AITC was completed system-wide by year-end 2000. In 2010, the Centeres for Medicare and Medicaide Services released a significantly upgraded version, MDS 3.0, to begin to be implemented on October 1, 2011 in VHA CLCs.  Training is underway currently.  The MDS 3.0 will generate a new set of Quality Indicators and Quality Monitors as well the RUGs will increase to 64 RUGs from the current 53 RUG groups.",

The questionnaire asks Veterans about their behaviors and their overall views on health. There are thirty-one standard questions in the survey. In addition, one of five custom modules can be selected to appear at the end of the survey to provide more feedback about the following areas: Diet and Physical Activity; Satisfaction; Smoking and Alcohol; Social Support; Utilization and Insurance. The SF-36V can be given to Veterans in one of two ways: through the mail or over the phone. Completed questionnaires are sent to the National Customer Feedback Center (NCFC) where they are scanned in and converted into a digital format.

Frequently performed other types of surgeries may also be excluded. Nurse reviewers at VAMCs gather the information from surgical data located in the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA) environment. Information is also collected from pre-and post-operative charts and from interviews with patients. This information is entered into VistA and transmitted daily by a batch process to the Hines Office of Information & Technology (OI&T) Field Office. While the database has been in operation since 1995, the system only contains data for the current fiscal year. The data from previous fiscal years is archived if later retrieval is needed. Valid transmissions are sent to the VASQIP office at Denver for analysis. Information from non-assessed surgeries is transmitted from the VAMCs to the Hines OI Field Office monthly.

This is accomplished through the Primary Care Management Module (PCMM) of the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture (VistA). When a patient cannot be assigned to a primary care team or position, the PCMM software asks if the patient should be placed on the EWL.  PCMM Wait List reports assist in the management of patients awaiting a primary care team or provider assignment. The EWL can also produce reports on demand regarding EWL related activities.

The success of this approach is reflected in our receipt of the Annual Leadership Award from the American College of Medical Quality.  Much of the data in LinKS and ASPIRE are simply not measured in other health systems - VA is raising the bar. When available, VA uses outside benchmarks but often sets VA standards or goals at a higher level. VA scores hospitals more than 30% different from the goal as underperforming or red and those only 10% different from the goal are shown in green in ASPIRE. But a red site within the VA might be a good performer compared to outside counterparts. The scoring system is designed to move VA forward. ASPIRE is not about finding fault",
