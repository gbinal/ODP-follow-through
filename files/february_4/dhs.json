        "Description": "Allows air carriers to file arrival information and bill data electronically. It also allows pre-arrival processing of air carriers, and enables the creation and maintenance of air manifest records.  In addition, the system enables the posting of bills and aids in enforcement screening.  AMS is a multi-modular cargo inventory control and release notification system. AMS interfaces directly with Customs Cargo Selectivity and In-Bond systems, and indirectly with ABI, allowing faster identification and release of low risk shipments. AMS speeds the flow of cargo and entry processing, and provides participants with electronic authorization of cargo release prior to arrival. It facilitates the intermodal movement and delivery of cargo by rail and trucks through the In-bond system. Carriers, port authorities, service bureaus, freight forwarders, and container freight stations can participate in AMS. AMS reduces reliance on paper documents and speeds the processing of manifest and waybill data.  Allows Master Vessel Operating Carriers to transmit manifest data electronically prior to the cargoï¿½s arrival.     It enables monitoring and updating of cargo movement, maintains on-line access to manifest data, maintains archives, and aids in determining which cargo to inspect.",
