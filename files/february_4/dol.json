Designated the C-CPI-U, the index supplements the existing Consumer Price Indexes already produced by the BLS: the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) and the CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). The C-CPI-U employs a Tornqvist formula and utilizes expenditure data in adjacent time periods in order to reflect the effect of any substitution that consumers make across item categories in response to changes in relative prices. The new measure is designed to be a closer approximation to a \"cost-of-living\" index than the present measures. The use of expenditure data for both a base period and the current period in order to average price change across item categories distinguishes the C-CPI-U from the existing CPI measures, which use only a single expenditure base period to compute the price change over \ntime.",

Prices, except for electricity, are collected monthly by BLS representatives in the 85 urban areas priced for the CPI. Electricity prices are collected for the BLS for the same 85 areas on a monthly basis by the Department of Energy using mail questionnaires. All fuel prices include applicable Federal, State, and local taxes; prices for natural gas and electricity also include fuel and purchased gas adjustments.",

Labor input and capital services are combined using\nchained superlative Tornqvist aggregation, applying weights that represent each component's share of total costs. The chained superlative Tornqvist index uses changing weights; the share in each year is averaged with the preceding year's share. The multifactor productivity indexes are derived by dividing an output index by an index of the combined inputs of labor, capital services, energy, non-energy materials, and purchased business services. The output index for manufacturing is computed using a chained superlative index (Tornqvist) of three-digit NAICS industry outputs. Industry output is measured as sectoral output, the total value of goods and services leaving the industry.",

All of the measures are based on data from the statistical agencies of the foreign economies covered or from international \norganizations. The Bureau does not initiate surveys or data collection programs abroad. The statistical concepts and methods used in different countries are developed primarily to meet domestic rather than international needs. When there are substantial conceptual differences, BLS adjusts the data to improve comparability or describes the differences \nso users will not draw misleading conclusions. In adjusting data for greater comparability, BLS must depend on the availability of relevant information, and in some instances it is necessary to make estimates based on incomplete data. Therefore it is possible to achieve only approximate statistical comparability among countries.",

The strength of the survey is that it allows data users to relate the expenditures and income of consumers to the characteristics of those consumers. The survey consists of two components, a quarterly Interview Survey and a weekly Diary Survey, each with its own questionnaire and sample. For the \nDiary survey, respondents complete a diary of expenses for two consecutive 1-week periods. The Diary survey is designed to obtain data on frequently purchased items, such as food or housekeeping supplies, that respondents are less likely to recall over time. For the Interview survey, respondents report data to an interviewer. Each sample household is interviewed once per quarter, for five consectutive quarters. This survey is designed to collect data on major items of expense, such as property purchases or vehicle purchases, and those that occur on a regular basis, such as rent or utility payments, that respondents recall for 3 months or longer.",

Private sector nonfarm establishments which have at least 50 initial claims for unemployment insurance (UI) filed against them during a consecutive \n5-week period are contacted by State agencies to determine whether those separations are of at least 31 days duration, and, if so, information is obtained on the total number of persons separated, the reasons for these separations, and recall expectations. Establishments are identified according to industry classification and location, and unemployment insurance claimants are identified by such \ndemographic characteristics as age, race, sex, ethnic group, and place of residence. The program yields information on an individual's entire spell of unemployment, to the point when regular unemployment insurance benefits are exhausted. It provides databases of establishments and claimants, both of which are used for further research and analysis.",

CFOI is a Federal-State \ncooperative program that has been active in all 50 States and the District of Columbia since 1992. To compile counts that are as complete as possible, CFOI uses multiple sources to identify, \nverify, and profile fatal worker injuries. Information about each workplace fatal injury is obtained by cross referencing the source records, such as death certificates, workers' \ncompensation reports, and Federal and State agency administrative reports. To ensure that fatal injuries are work-related, cases are substantiated with two or more independent source documents, or a source document and a follow-up questionnaire. CFOI publishes detailed data on case characteristics such as the event or exposure leading to the \nfatal injury, the source of the fatal injury, and worker activity at the time of the incident. Event or exposure, source, and other case characteristic codes are currently based on the BLS \nOccupational Injury and Illness Classification System (OIICS) 2.01, which can be viewed at our Web site at http://www.bls.gov/iif/oshoiics.htm.",

        "description": "In Fiscal Year 2010, the Longshore Division adopted a new set of performance measures aimed at improving program effectiveness by facilitating the prompt delivery of benefits to injured workers and their families. Two new performance measures target the timeliness of the Employer's First Report of Injury and the First Payment of Compensation, thereby improving initial claims processing and benefit delivery outcomes. The \"First Report of Injury\" measure tracks the time from the date of the injury or death, or the date of the employer's knowledge of the injury and the onset of disability, whichever is later, to the date the Longshore District Office receives the Employer's First Report of Injury (Form LS-202). The \"First Payment\" measure tracks the time it takes the employer or insurance carrier to issue the First Payment of Compensation after the worker becomes disabled for work or after the worker's death. Performance targets aim to increase the percentage of cases in which employers submit their First Reports of Injury and employers and carriers issue the First Payments of Compensation within 30 days. Performance results are shown in the tables below. The DBA performance measures were introduced in 2010, and the non-DBA measures in 2011.",
