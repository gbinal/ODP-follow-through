    "description": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) periodically produce its HUD Subprime and Manufactured home Lender List for the lenders who specialize in either subprime or manufactured home lending, even though beginning with 2004 HMDA reporting, lenders are required to identify loans for manufactured housing and loans in which the APR on the loan exceeds a comparable Treasury APR. The HUD Subprime and Manufactured home Lender List contains the names of those lenders, their agency codes, and lender identification numbers. The agency code and lender identification numbers should be used to link to the individual HMDA loan application records (LARS). The file also contains a concatenated field, IDD, which is a combination of the agency code and lender identification number. The HUD Subprime and Manufactured home Lender List has annually been updated and revised in response to feedback from lenders, policy analysts, housing advocacy groups, and other users of the list. HUD deletes lenders and adds others based on that feedback. ",
